# link log is different than log transforming the raw data: "The transformation changes the raw data. 
# The link function doesnâ€™t touch the raw data, instead you can think of it as a transformation of the model for the mean 
# of the raw data. https://www.r-bloggers.com/2018/10/generalized-linear-models-understanding-the-link-function/

# logistic regression uses logit link but since gamma is 0-inf we use log link instead

# using glmmTMB because it allows zero inflation 
# Include random effect: glmmTMB is a mixed model function so it requires
# at least one random effect with the fixed effects
