Kirk",2022,Factors Affecting Survival of Attwater?s Prairie-Chicken Broods,Journal of Fish and Wildlife Management,13,2,"Annual population changes of most grouse, including the imperiled Attwater's prairie-chicken Tympanuchus cupido attwateri, are driven by annual reproductive success. Previous research identified poor survival of chicks as a primary bottleneck for recovery of this species. We evaluated the relative importance of 26 factors in 5 categories (weather and topography, habitat, plant phenology, time and site, hen characteristics) on Attwater's prairie-chicken brood survival to 2 wk posthatch (the period when chick mortality is highest) and on the number of chicks per brood at 6 wk posthatch (when chicks are capable of independent survival). Factors with most support for predicting brood survival to 2 wk included invertebrate dry mass, ordinal date, an index to maximum photosynthetic activity of vegetation from multispectral imagery, and proportion of brood locations within areas treated to suppress red imported fire ants Solenopsis invicta. Broods were most likely to survive if they hatched between early and late May and were located within areas 1) that were treated to suppress red imported fire ants, 2) where vegetation produced intermediate values for the maximum photosynthetic activity index, and 3) that supported high invertebrate biomass. The number of chicks per brood surviving to 6 wk posthatch was best predicted by a nonlinear relationship with a drought index during the first 2 wk posthatch, and it was maximized when average values of the drought index indicated moderately depleted soil moisture, but not severe drought. Our finding that the average drought index during the first 2 wk after hatch had more support for predicting the number of chicks per brood at 6 wk than did the average drought index for the entire 6 wk emphasizes the importance of the first 2 wk for Attwater's prairie-chickens. This comprehensive analysis of factors affecting Attwater's prairie-chicken brood survival provides valuable information to guide management and recovery efforts for this species.",10.3996/JFWM-21-054,,EMG,Phasianidae,Insect availability,Reproductive success,Yes,.,,"Attwater Prairie Chicken National Wildlife Refuge (APCNWR; Colorado County; 29.7°N, 96.3°W)",,,managed open grasslands containing mid–tall native grass species,Attwater Prairie Chicken,,,,mean mass per invertebrate > 1 mg and < 10 mg,sweep net,invertebrates,continuous,Yes,1001a

Breeding and feeding records of a Verreauxs' eagle (Aquila verreauxii), pair in the garden were analysed in relation to changes in the local environment due to urbanization. Natural prey-suitable habitat within a 10 km radius of the nest diminished by approximately 29.7 km(2) (9.5%) during 1984-2007. In 2007 approximately 116.7 km(2) (37.2%) of suitable prey habitat remained within this radius. Feeding data within a more recent period (1996-2008) suggest that there has been a switch from an optimal diet of rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) to less characteristic avian prey species such as helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris), francolins (Francolinus spp.) and supplemented food. Annual breeding success indicated few inconsistencies in incubation period, nestling period and post-fledging dispersal period relative to breeding Verreauxs' eagle elsewhere. Despite a reduction in the suitable prey habitat and change in prey composition (including supplemental feeding), breeding has persisted successfully over a 16-year period (1993-2008). The presence of a large apex avian predator in an extensively urbanized metropolis is encouraging with regard to ecological integrity and functioning but the future prospects for these Verreauxs' eagles may depend on an as yet unknown threshold of prey abundance, both natural and supplemented, and environmental disturbance.",10.3957/056.042.0109,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we compared the influence of prey abundance and the amount of shelter area on the relationship between habitat and breeding performance. We focused on the forest-dwelling northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis in an agroforestry system. Using structural equation modelling, we tested the associations between reproductive performance and three explanatory factors: habitat structure, abundance of food resources or levels of mobbing disturbance, and prey supply to the nest. Our results suggest that habitat structure influences reproductive performance through shelter rather than through prey abundance. During the study period, forested habitats in the breeding territories provided shelter to the goshawk, reducing disturbance by carrion crows Corvus corone, which acted as large, aggressive, social mobbers. Decreased disturbance increased prey supply to the nest, probably because it favored food accessibility and male goshawk foraging efficiency. Habitat was not significantly associated with quality of the breeders, both in terms of body size and seniority in the territories. Our findings suggest that reproductive performance, and therefore habitat quality, may depend more on sheltered access to food resources than on the amount of food available. Our observation that mobbers decrease predator foraging efficiency highlights the possibility of designing effective, socially acceptable predator management strategies to protect sensitive domestic prey.",10.1111/jav.03060,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In our study we analysed prey composition of breeding imperial eagles (Aquila heliaca) in East Hungary, where 434 nesting events in 81 different territories had been monitored between 1995 and 2004. We identified 1297 prey items originating from 43 bird and 16 mammalian species (532 and 764 specimens, respectively). Three prey species, the brown hare (Lepus europaeus), the hamster (Cricetus cricetus) and the pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), seem to have especially important role in the diet of imperial eagles in Hungary, although their relative frequencies varied greatly among different regions. We found that eagles were less productive in a region where hamster was the main prey (West Zemplen Mts) as compared to a recently colonized hare-dominated region (Heves Plain), suggesting that hares may provide a better food source than hamsters. The increase of game species in the diet of imperial eagles could generate hostility in hunters. Possible conflict between nature conservation and small-game management may be resolved by raising public awareness and by common projects to improve hare and pheasant habitats.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The densities of the main prey species, European wild rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus), red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), wood pigeon (Columba palumbus), and rock dove (Columba livia), representing 90.2% of the biomass, were analysed in 19 territories occupied by pairs of Bonelli's eagles and 15 potential territories that were unoccupied but appropriate for nesting. We found no significant differences in prey density between the two types of territories. Contrary to other raptor species, we found no significant relationship between the density of their main prey species and the distance of the neighbouring pairs, either between that density and breeding success. These findings, together with the prior knowledge of nest-site selection of this eagle in the study area, can be used for proper planning of conservation strategies. These should avoid unnecessary effort to increase the eagle's food supply, and should promote the reintroduction of individuals to suitable sites for Bonelli's eagle.",10.1016/S0006-3207(99)00117-2,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Generally, earlier breeding birds have larger clutch sizes, and the advancing spring could thus potentially increase breeding success. Shifts in spring phenology can, however, be crucial for bird reproduction, and mistiming the breeding event may even have negative consequences for population development. Our aim was to explore how weather and prey abundance relates to the breeding performance of a north European top predator, the northern goshawk Accipiter gentilis. Our nationwide dataset from Finland, spanning the period 1989-2004, shows that ambient weather has a greater impact on the timing and success of breeding than the density of grouse Tetraonidae, the main prey of goshawks. Higher early spring temperatures were associated with advancing hatching date of goshawks. Correspondingly, grouse density and temperature during laying and brooding were positively associated with brood size, while precipitation showed a negative connection. Applying our models to a future scenario of climate warming, combined with a 50 % reduction in grouse density, suggests that average breeding dates will advance only 2.5 days and average breeding success would remain the same. Notably, breeding success was not spatially equal throughout Finland, as northern and eastern populations suffered most from declining grouse densities. The observed pattern is thus the opposite to what is expected from a population situated at the northern edge of its distribution range, and thus may help to understand why populations may not increase at the northern edge of their thermal distribution due to climate change.",10.1007/s00442-012-2411-z,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we used artificial nest experiments with noise manipulation to investigate the influence of anthropogenic noise on nest predation during the breeding and non-breeding seasons and in different forest habitats. We found that the noise treatment did not alter the predation rates or survival probabilities of birds in artificial nests. However, the diversity and species composition of nest predators in artificial pine forests varied between breeding and nonbreeding seasons, which may be explained by season-specific adaption of nest predators to bird nests or the unstable ecosystems of artificial forests. The diversity and species composition of nest predators differed between the different forests, probably because of differences in habitat heterogeneity. Predation time varied with treatment, season, and habitat, although most predators were nocturnal mammals. Niche segregation or changes in optimal foraging time may explain this phenomenon.",10.1016/j.avrs.2023.100121,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1010,"Tornberg, Risto",2000,Effects of changing landscape structure on the predator-prey interaction between goshawk and grouse,Acta Universitatis Ouluensis A Scientiae Rerum Naturalium,NA,346,"I studied the ecology of the goshawk-grouse relationship in Oulu, northern Finland, during and outside the breeding season, by radio-telemetry. This included museum samples of goshawk to obtain a better ecological as well as a better evolutionary understanding of it. The proportion of grouse in the diet of goshawks has decreased since the 1960's, in accordance with the decline of grouse populations. The main prey groups replacing the lacking grouse were corvids, squirrels and hares. The proportion of grouse was highest in spring and it decreased towards the end of the nestling phase. The most preferred grouse species were hazel grouse Bonasa bonasia and willow grouse Lagopus lagopus. Preferences for different prey types are not explained by active choices of goshawk, but by changes in the vulnerability of the prey species. The nestling phase, when food demand is highest, is not adjusted to when prey supply is highest, but before it. The size and shape of the goshawks has changed from the 1960's. Adult males became smaller but females larger. Both became relatively longer winged and tailed. Decrease of male's size may be a response to the change in the food supply. Prey types replacing grouse are generally smaller, which may cause the change in the male's morphology. Females being less active during the breeding season may not be affected. For the female to be larger is advantageous in winter when they kill 'over large' prey like mountain hares Lepus timidus and capercaillie cocks Tetrao urogallus. Wintering goshawks were mainly females in adult plumage that tended to stay in the study area. However, only one third bred locally. More than one quarter of all hawks died during the study. Although known to be inhabitants of old forests, which this study supports, goshawks are fairly well adapted to mosaic landscape resulting from modern forestry, providing that suitable sized prey is available. Females have less problems, probably because hares, the main winter prey for females, are not affected negatively by forestry, like grouse and squirrels are, the main prey for males. Goshawks have a remarkable impact on grouse populations, especially when non-territorial hawks, 'floaters' are also included. About one half of the total mortality rate of grouse may be due to goshawk predation. Goshawk predation accords to predictions of general predation theory and may be a noticeable factor contributing to cyclicity in grouse.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We investigated cost during incubation by experimentally enlarging 25 clutches of white-tailed ptarmigan Lagopus leucurus. The experiment was conducted in 2 years, one with harsh weather that forced a natural delay in reproduction. When forced to delay egg-laying, females began incubation with poorer body condition and foraged more during incubation. Rates of mass loss during incubation were not affected by clutch enlargement, and did not differ between harsh and benign years; however, females that were heavier at the start of incubation lost more mass than lighter females. Clutch-enlarged females had reduced nest attendance compared to control birds in both years and incubation periods increased by up to 2 days relative to controls. In the harsh year, there was a trend for clutch-enlarged females to have lower nest success, but there was no effect on overwinter survival. Different behavioral responses by females in the 2 years showed that incubation costs may depend on other factors such as female quality, food supply, or weather conditions. Incubation is a dynamic period during which birds may adjust energy balances by varying body condition and food intake.",NA,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1012,"Byholm, Patrik and Kekkonen, Mari",2008,Food regulates reproduction differently in different habitats: Experimental evidence in the Goshawk,Ecology (Washington D C),89,6,"Food supplementation experiments have been widely used to get detailed insight into how food supply contributes to the reproductive performance of wild animals. Surprisingly, even though food seldom is distributed evenly in space, variation in local habitat quality has usually not been controlled for in food supplementation studies. With results from a two-year feeding experiment involving a habitat-sensitive avian top predator, the Northern Goshawk Accipiter gentilis, we show that treatment effects on goshawk reproductive performance are habitat dependent. Extra food reduced nestling mortality in low-quality territories where prime habitat (forest) is scarce, but not in high-quality territories where prime habitat is abundant. Consequently, brood size did not differ between treatment categories in heavily forested territories, but fledgling numbers differed between unfed and fed goshawk pairs breeding in territories where forest is scarce. However, because extra food was not superabundant, this artificial increase in offspring number induced a dramatic decrease in nestling condition in low-quality territories. Treatment effects were detected even after controlling statistically for other potentially confounding effects (year, territory identity) and strongly covaried with territory-specific abundances of the most important summer prey species. These results highlight the importance of acknowledging the effect that small-scale variation in habitat quality and availability of natural food may have on the results of food supplementation experiments. In order to assess the generality of food supplementation effects, the integration of habitat heterogeneity and variation in food abundance is thus needed, especially among species in which small-scale variation in habitat quality influences demographic patterns.",10.1890/07-0675.1,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pacific loons successfully reproduced on both impoundments and ponds. Though success tended to be lower on impoundments, no significant differences were detected between the two water body types. The principal cause of reproductive failure on both impoundments and ponds in 1993 appears to have been predation by arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus) during incubation. Predation losses on impoundments often were associated with large water-level drawdowns, which apparently increased opportunities for predation of stranded clutches. I found no differences in chick mortality or adult foraging effort between impoundments and ponds. Over 99% of the prey items delivered to chicks were invertebrates captured in freshwater wetlands. Reproductive output of Pacific loons may be improved by increasing the stability of water levels at impoundments used for nesting. I found no evidence that draining impoundments would improve habitat for loons (or invertebrate-eating waterfowl species) at Prudhoe Bay.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depredation of sage-grouse nests can limit their productivity. In Wyoming, lethal removal of common ravens (Corvus corax: hereafter ""ravens"") and coyotes (Canis latrans) has been conducted by USDA/APHIS/Wildlife Services (WS) for the protection of livestock. During 2008-2011, we evaluated sage-grouse nest success in study sites (1) where WS initiated a raven removal program, (2) WS removed coyotes, and (3) WS did not manipulate ravens and/or coyotes. Precipitation and temperature were analyzed individually and as interactive effects with coyote removal numbers as sources of annual variation in nest success. Over the course of our study, raven densities decreased at study sites with WS raven removal, while sage-grouse nest success in those study sites was higher during years with reduced raven density. Temperature effects on nest success were dependent on timing with successful nests having cooler temperatures prior to the nesting season (conditions promoting water retention and grass growth) and warmer temperatures the week before nest fate (conducive to degradation of sage-grouse odorants used by mammalian predators). Lower nest success was associated with more lethally removed coyotes interacting with greater.precipitation suggesting mesopredator release. Raven removal may have a place in sage-grouse management as an interim mitigation measure when sage-grouse populations are subjected to high densities of ravens. However, long-term solutions are necessary, such as reducing supplemental food sources and perch structures used by ravens. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

European turtle doves Streptopelia turtur feed on seeds collected on the ground, and are readily attracted to supplementary provided grain at feeding stations. Supplementary feeding is a common management practice on hunting estates around the world. This study was conducted in 40 hunting estates located in central west Spain: 20 sites where supplementary food was provided to attract turtle doves and 20 control sites without feeding stations. At sites with supplemental feeding, the field age ratio was 20% higher and the hunted age ratio was 33% higher than at control sites, indicating a positive effect of the food supplementation of the breeding success around supplemented sites. Both the amount of food provided per day and the amount of time where supplemental food was given (20-120 days) were positively correlated with the field age ratio and, less strongly, with the hunted age ratio. These data suggest that providing extra food can increase the breeding success of this species when the amount provided is sufficiently large and when supplementary food is provided early in the breeding season. However, hunting pressure was also higher at supplemented sites. Future studies should therefore closely monitor the positive and negative effects in order to ascertain which management practices will ensure the viability of these important European turtle dove populations.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the relative role of top-down versus bottom-up drivers is of particular interest in understanding ecosystem dynamics. Our goal was to explore predator-prey relationships in a boreal ecosystem in interior Alaska through the use of multispecies long-term monitoring data. We used 29years of field data and a dynamic multistate site occupancy modeling approach to explore the trophic relationships between an apex predator, the golden eagle, and cyclic populations of the two primary prey species available to eagles early in the breeding season, snowshoe hare and willow ptarmigan. We found that golden eagle reproductive success was reliant on prey numbers, but also responded prior to changes in the phase of the snowshoe hare population cycle and failed to respond to variation in hare cycle amplitude. There was no lagged response to ptarmigan populations, and ptarmigan populations recovered quickly from the low phase. Together, these results suggested that eagle reproduction is largely driven by bottom-up processes, with little evidence of top-down control of either ptarmigan or hare populations. Although the relationship between golden eagle reproductive success and prey abundance had been previously established, here we established prey populations are likely driving eagle dynamics through bottom-up processes. The key to this insight was our focus on golden eagle reproductive parameters rather than overall abundance. Although our inference is limited to the golden eagle-hare-ptarmigan relationships we studied, our results suggest caution in interpreting predator-prey abundance patterns among other species as strong evidence for top-down control.",10.1002/ece3.3800,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, chick survival was also higher in years with lower May temperatures and lower August temperatures in the previous year, the latter probably related to prey abundance in the subsequent breeding season.

We evaluated effects of supplemental feeding used as religious/cultural practices which could potentially aid conservation of endangered phasianids. We compared fed breeding groups to neighboring nonfed groups. Fed groups initiated first clutches significantly earlier than nonfed groups. Earlier laying groups within fed and nonfed groups showed significantly lower hatching rates than later groups; however, fed groups showed significantly higher hatching rates than nonfed groups laying in the same period. Earlier laying increased opportunities to renest. All six fed groups with clutch failures renested compared to only one of five nonfed groups with clutch failures. Fed female breeders showed significantly greater investment in their young with larger clutches and larger eggs, which likely increased survivability of early hatchlings. We observed no predation on birds at feeding sites and recorded only four cases of predation on incubating females, which showed no detectable difference between fed and nonfed groups. Ground-nesting birds typically face high risks of predation. Ten of the 48 groups nested in trees, which occurs in few phasianid species. Tree nests showed significantly higher hatching rates compared to ground nests; however, we found no significant difference in tree nesting between fed and nonfed groups. This partridge is one of four gallinaceous species with cooperative breeding. Breeding groups with helpers had significantly greater reproductive success than single pairs, and fed female breeders with helpers laid bigger eggs than single pairs. Comparing annual reproductive output per group, fed groups not only produced significantly more independent young (>= 150 days post-hatching), their young hatched significantly earlier, which likely have greater reproductive value over later hatched young of nonfed groups.

To demonstrate such a link, evidence is needed of (1) an effect of food abundance on breeding performance or survival; (2) an effect of breeding performance or survival on population change; and (3) pesticide effects on food resources, sufficient to reduce breeding performance or survival, and hence to affect the rate of population change. Evidence under all three categories is only available for one species, the Grey Partridge Perdix perdix, although data showing effects of pesticides on food resources and relationships between food resources and breeding performance are also available for some other species. This paper reports on recent work investigating the effects of pesticides on Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella and Skylark Alauda arvensis during the breeding season. The probability of brood reduction in Yellowhammer was affected by the proportion of the foraging area around the nest which was sprayed with insecticide. No significant effects of pesticides were recorded on Skylark chick condition or growth rate, but sample sizes were small. Invertebrate food abundance affected chick condition (Skylark) and the number of chicks fledging (Yellowhammer and Corn Bunting Miliaria calandra; relationship for the latter derived from re-analysis of data from an earlier study). Other recent work is briefly reviewed and the current evidence for the indirect effects of pesticides is summarized.

The northwestern North American population of Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos canadensis initiates courtship and nesting in early spring when prey diversity is low and weather conditions are severe. Snowshoe Hare Lepus americanus and Willow Ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus, the primary prey of Golden Eagles early in their nesting season in interior Alaska, both exhibit cyclical fluctuations in abundance, providing the opportunity to investigate such relationships. We used Bayesian hierarchical models to explore variation in territory occupancy, nesting rates, nesting success and productivity of Golden Eagles from 1988 to 2010 in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska, in relation to annual and site-specific parameters including prey abundance, weather conditions, elevation and human activity. We also investigated the long-term fluctuations of breeding performance over the course of the study. The abundance of Hares influenced both the number of Eagles that laid eggs and the number of Eagles that produced fledglings.

In the natural environment of the ancestors, fitness (reproductive success) is often favoured by an ability to locate and remember food sites, whereas in captivity, fitness may be more related to the ability to grow and reproduce efficiently under stable food conditions. We hypothesized that domestication and selection for production traits have caused animals to react less actively to food shortage. In this experiment, 26 red junglefowl (RJF) and 27 White Leghorn layers (WL), the latter selected for high egg production, were exposed to 0, 3 and 24 h of food deprivation while housed in furnished cages. After food deprivation, we quantified the bird's behaviour, in a series of tests. Birds of both breeds performed more foraging-exploring, less preening behaviour and less perching with increasing length of food deprivation. However, when tested in a group, RJF showed a more active response than WL to food shortage by reducing perching time and increasing the foraging and exploration time on the ground, which may be interpreted as a more risk-prone behaviour. Furthermore, when tested individually, there was a breed effect on response in the open field and the novel object tests, where RJF were more cautious than WL. The results may reflect different feeding strategies: the behaviour of RJF would probably be more adaptive in a natural environment, while the behaviour shown by WL may allow more investment in production traits in a more predictable environment.

Hens restricted to pre-lay maintenance levels of nutrition after photostimulation initially laid good quality eggs at the same rate as the fully fed hens.

A suggested cause is that foraging efficiency benefits accrue to diet specialists. This diet specificity hypothesis thus predicts that diet breadth and reproductive success should be inversely related within species. We highlight, however, that a prey availability hypothesis also makes the same prediction in some circumstances. Hence, when high diet specificity results from high encounter rates with an abundant, preferred prey, then prey availability may affect reproductive success, with diet specialization as an incidental correlate. Using three insular study areas in western Scotland, we examine diet specificity and reproductive success in Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos. Diet breadth and breeding productivity were not negatively related in any of our study areas, even though birds with specific diets did tend to have a higher incidence of preferred prey (grouse and lagomorphs) in the diet. Indeed, in two study areas there was evidence that diet generalists had higher breeding productivity. Our results therefore failed to support the diet specificity hypothesis but were consistent with the prey availability hypothesis. We highlight that although many other studies are superficially consistent with the diet specificity hypothesis, our study is not alone in failing to provide support and that the hypothesis does not provide a generic explanation for all relevant results. Diet specificity in predators can be at least partially a response to prey diversity, availability and distribution, and benefits associated with different prey types, so that being a generalist is not necessarily intrinsically disadvantageous. We suggest that the available evidence is more consistent with variation in prey abundance and availability as a more influential factor explaining spatial and temporal variation in breeding productivity of 'generalist' species such as the Golden Eagle. Under this argument, prey abundance and availability are the main drivers of variation in reproductive output. Diet specificity is a consequence of variation in prey availability, rather than a substantial cause of variation in reproductive success.",10.1111/j.1474-919X.2009.00924.x,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The population size increased from 31 breeding pairs in 1977 to 72 pairs in the early 1990s, after which the population started to decline (Fig. 5). The population decline during the 1990s was mainly due to illegal persecution, yet after illegal persecution was reduced during the 2000s, the population size continued to decline. The mean reproductive output was stable during 1977-1997, but then also started to decline (Fig. 6).The Goshawk is a generalist predator feeding on the most available and profitable prey species, which in Vendsyssel mainly were pigeons, corvids and thrushes. In this study I investigated whether the observed decline in population size and average reproductive output could be due to reduced Goshawk prey availability.Based on estimated local population density and prey body mass, an annual biomass index was calculated for 38 common prey species (contributing 92% of the numbers and 90% of the biomass, respectively, of Goshawk prey.During the study period, remains from 34645 Goshawk prey individuals were collected during the breeding season, and the annual distribution of the main prey groups are shown in Fig. 4.Tab. 1 shows the population trends for the most common prey species.

Nonetheless, when prey availability declines, interspecific competition among consumers should increase and could lead to increased intraguild predation. We examined these potential effects in a generalist predator of the tundra, the Glaucous Gull (Larus hyperboreus), over a 7-yr period characterized by large fluctuations in lemming abundance, a potential prey item for gulls. We studied diet by analyzing regurgitated pellets collected at nests and blood nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes, and we monitored annual nesting density and reproductive success on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada. Stable isotopes revealed a relatively similar contribution of terrestrial and marine food sources to the gull diet, although the terrestrial contribution increased in the year of high lemming abundance. According to analysis of pellets, diet during incubation was dominated by geese and lemmings, whereas geese were the main prey during chick-rearing. As expected for a generalist predator, annual variation in diet during incubation reflected overall lemming abundance, and the increased consumption of geese during chick-rearing was associated with an influx of goose families into the study area at that time. Gull nest density, laying date, clutch size, and mass gain of chicks did not vary with lemming population fluctuations. Hatching success, on the other hand, was positively related to lemming abundance and was greater for nests located on islets than for those along the shores of ponds and lakes. Intraguild predation on gull eggs by predators such as Arctic foxes, which primarily feed on lemmings during the summer, was probably the main cause of nest failure. Although a generalist predator like the Glaucous Gull has a diversified diet and may feed only opportunistically on lemmings, our results suggest that large cyclical fluctuations in lemming abundance may still affect gull reproductive success through intraguild predation.",10.1642/AUK-14-273.1,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this may not apply to all alternative prey groups in patchy landscapes. We investigated the demographic and aggregative numerical and functional responses of Common Buzzards Buteo buteo in relation to variations in prey abundance on a moor managed for Red Grouse Lagopus lagopus scotica in south-west Scotland over three consecutive breeding and non-breeding seasons. We predicted that predation of Red Grouse by Buzzards would increase when abundance of their preferred Field Vole Microtus agrestis prey declined. As vole abundance fluctuated, Buzzards responded functionally by eating voles in relation to their abundance, but they did not respond demographically in terms of either breeding success or density. During a vole crash year, Buzzards selected a wider range of prey typical of enclosed farmland habitats found on the moorland edge but fewer Grouse from the heather moorland. During a vole peak year, prey remains suggested a linear relationship between Grouse density and the number of Grouse eaten (a Type 1 functional response), which was not evident in either intermediate or vole crash years. Buzzard foraging intensity varied between years as vole abundance fluctuated, and foraging intensity declined with increasing heather cover. Our findings did not support the prediction that predation of Red Grouse would increase when vole abundance was low. Instead, they suggest that Buzzards predated Grouse incidentally while hunting for voles, which may increase when vole abundances are high through promoting foraging in heather moorland habitats where Grouse are more numerous. Our results suggest that declines in their main prey may not result in increased predation of all alternative prey groups when predators inhabit patchy landscapes. We suggest that when investigating predator diet and impacts on prey, knowledge of all resources and habitats that are available to predators is important.",10.1111/ibi.12471,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Local population studies have shown that sex allocation among many birds and mammals seems to be partly non-random and in connection to surrounding factors, such as environmental or parental quality. In this scenario, if environmental quality varies in space and time, it is feasible that environmental quality also comes to influence offspring sex ratio on larger geographical scales. 2. Investigating this idea - using nation-wide data sets on size-dimorphic Finnish northern goshawks Accipiter gentilis from 1989 to 1998 - we found that offspring sex ratio is related to spatial and temporal variation in availability of their main prey, woodland grouse species. 3. In a majority of locations (n = 73), broods are large and male-biased when grouse density is high, while small and female-biased broods are found in areas and times with low grouse density. When adjusted for grouse density, the correlation between brood size and sex ratio disappears, but the correlation between grouse density and sex ratio remains. 4. We also found evidence indicating a mechanism balancing local offspring sex ratios towards the previously rarer sex with a time lag of 1 year. That is, local sex ratios in subsequent years are negatively correlated. 5. Our study highlights the importance of inclusion of both time and space in sex ratio studies. Ignorance of these dimensions could explain a great deal of the inconsistency in many earlier local sex ratio studies. 6. Irrespective of whether the observed pattern is the result of facultative manipulation, sex biased mortality, or both, it is suggested that the male-biased sex ratio during periods of high grouse availability maximizes goshawk reproductive success.",10.1046/j.1365-2656.2002.00663.x,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some factors such as the sudden shift from abundant commercial energy-rich diet to natural food and absence of experience at looking for natural food resources could cause a rapid physical deterioration, being more vulnerable to predation and disease. To determine fasting capacity in red-legged partridges, we fasted 32 birds during 4 days and then we refed them, collecting blood samples and body masses during the experiment. Red-legged partridges entered in the third critic phase of fasting, in which body proteins became the main energetic source, after 48 h of fasting. The fasting period caused an average loss of 17% of their initial body mass and only attained a 93.6% of their initial body mass after 24 days of refeeding. The limited capacity to resist fasting in the red-legged partridge could be one of the reasons for the low success in restocking, mainly in those where neither supplementary feeding nor acclimation period is allowed for birds before they are finally released.

Availability of optimal prey can affect reproductive success in raptors, especially in the Arctic, where dramatic differences in prey availability occur both within and between years. However, behavioral responses of dietary specialist, resident predators such as Gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus) to changes in prey availability remain poorly understood. To improve understanding of how climate-driven changes in prey availability may affect diet of avian predators in the Arctic, we characterized Gyrfalcon diet on the Seward Peninsula, Alaska, in 2014 and 2015 from images representing 2008 prey items obtained by motion-activated cameras at 20 nests. We documented two important dietary shifts: the proportion of ptarmigan (Willow Ptarmigan [Lagopus lagopus] and Rock Ptarmigan [L. muta]) in the diet declined throughout the brood-rearing period in both years, and also differed between years. In both cases, ptarmigan were replaced by Arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii) in the diet. Despite shifts in prey composition, dietary breadth did not change, which revealed a facultative shift in prey use in which Gyrfalcons relied on prey of large size rather than prey of a particular taxon. We describe previously undocumented prey-use patterns during Gyrfalcon breeding, specifically an interchange between two prey species that are keystones in tundra ecology. These results are important for informing predictive models of climate change and adaptive species management plans.

Slightly later development of Hymenoptera as compared with that of Lepidoptera contributed in extending the period of high larval abundances for more than one week. The timing of breeding of the two species appears, therefore, to match the temporal distribution of insect food for the fast-growing chicks as they hatch several days before the peak in larval volumes. In one year, when mating was advanced, presumably due to exceptionally warm weather before mating (yet the temporal abundance of larvae was unchanged), breeding success was higher than in years when mating occurred later.",10.5735/086.047.0403,,JRY,Phasianidae,Insect availability,No,No,No measure or report of repro success.

This has led to increases in generalists' population numbers across landscapes that were previously less suitable for their current demographic rates. Of particular concern are growing populations of common ravens (Corvus corax; ravens), because predation by ravens is linked to population declines of sensitive species. Ecosystem managers seek management options for mitigating the adverse effects of raven predation where unsustainable predator-prey conflicts exist. We present 3 case studies examining how manipulating reproductive success of ravens influences demographic rates of 2 sensitive prey species. Two case studies examine impacts of removing raven nests or oiling raven eggs on nest survival of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse) within Wyoming and the Great Basin of California and Nevada, USA, respectively. The third case study uses Mojave desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii; tortoise) decoys to examine effects of oiling raven eggs on depredation rates of juvenile tortoises in the Mojave Desert in California. Initial trial years from all 3 case studies were consistent in finding improved vital rates associated with the application of strategies for reducing reproductive success of ravens. Specifically, removal of raven nests resulted in increased nest survival of sage-grouse within treatment areas where predation by ravens was the primary cause of nest failure. In addition, nest survival of sage-grouse and survival of juvenile tortoise decoys was higher following a treatment of oiling the eggs of ravens in their nests at 2 sites within the Great Basin and 4 tortoise conservation areas in the Mojave Desert in California. Along with specialized technologies that can make techniques such as egg-oiling more feasible, these findings support these management practices as important tools for managing ravens, especially in areas where breeding ravens have negative impacts on sensitive prey species.",NA,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Crustaceans were the main prey accounting, for over 90% of the diet by mass. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the main prey, in 17 out of 22 years. Amphipods Themisto gaudichaudii were the main prey in 1994 and 2009, fish in 2004, and the euphausiids Thysanoessa spp. and Euphausia frigida in 2000. There was no clearly dominant prey group in 1999. Prey diversity and the frequency occurrence of T. gaudichaudii both increased with a decreasing proportion of E. superba in the diet. There was strong evidence that macaroni penguins have a sigmoidal functional response, indicating that this kind of response should be accounted for when devising ecosystem-based management reference points for seabirds. The energy and mass of all euphausiids combined (rather than E. superba in particular) in the diet were the most reliable predictors of chick fledging mass; the correlation between model-predicted and observed values was 0.84. The gross energy content of individual meals was often above average in years when the diets contained fewer euphausiids, but fledging mass was always below average in these years. Although macaroni penguins are able to feed on a variety of prey types, chick growth was always severely impacted by a shortage of euphausiids due to higher energy or time costs associated with feeding on alternative prey types. Given their reliance on euphausiids, macaroni penguins would be particularly vulnerable to potential climate-driven declines in krill stocks.",10.3354/meps09930,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In birds, limiting resources can affect growth as nestlings, but also fitness and survival as adults. Following periods of food restriction, individuals may accelerate development, undergoing a period of rapid ""catch-up"" growth, in an attempt to reach the appropriate size at adulthood. Previous studies of altricial birds have shown that catch-up growth can have negative consequences in adulthood, although this has not been explored in species with different developmental strategies. Here, we investigated the effects of resource limitation and the subsequent period of catch-up growth, on the morphological and metabolic phenotype of adult Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), a species with a precocial developmental strategy. Because males and females differ in adult body size, we also test whether food restriction had sex-specific effects. Birds that underwent food restriction early in development had muscles of similar size and functional maturity, but lower adult body mass than controls. There was no evidence of sex-specific sensitivity of food restriction on adult body mass; however, there was evidence for body size. Females fed ad lib were larger than males fed ad lib, while females subjected to food restriction were of similar size to males. Adults that had previously experienced food restriction did not have an elevated metabolic rate, suggesting that in contrast to altricial nestlings, there was no metabolic carry-over effect of catch-up growth into adulthood. While Japanese quail can undergo accelerated growth after re-feeding, timing of food restriction may be important to adult size, particularly in females. However, greater developmental flexibility compared to altricial birds may contribute to the lack of metabolic carryover effects at adulthood.",10.1007/s00360-013-0751-6,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this study, we assessed fluctuations in diet composition and monitored various reproductive parameters over a nine-year period in a Golden Eagle population in an Eastern European peatland. The identification of 2439 prey specimens from 84 species revealed that the studied eagles primarily preyed upon birds (constituting 78.3% of prey numbers and 67.2% of prey biomass) and less on mammals (21.6% and 32.8%, respectively). Grouse emerged as the most important prey group (31% and 27%), followed by waterfowl (17%) and hares (8% and 14%). The most significant prey species, both in terms of numbers and weight, were the Black Grouse, Mountain Hare, Common Crane, and Capercaillie. The share of the Black Grouse decreased, while those of the White-fronted Goose, Roe Deer, and hares increased. The food niche, as measured by the Levins' index, was broad (6.6), and it expanded during the study. On average, 58.3% of Golden Eagle pairs initiated breeding annually, with 69.1% successfully completing it, and 0.41 young per occupied territory were produced annually; there was pronounced interannual variation in reproductive performance. These fluctuations were associated with the shares of White-fronted Goose, Capercaillie, Mountain Hare and Roe Deer in the diet, suggesting that these species may be gaining increasing importance for the Golden Eagle, particularly following the decline of the Black Grouse.",10.3390/d16010069,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Habitat heterogeneity has important repercussions for species abundance, demography and life-history patterns. While habitat effects have been more thoroughly studied in top-down situations (e.g. in association with predation), their role in bottom-up situations (e.g. in association with food abundance) has been less explored and the underlying mechanism(s) behind the ecological patterns have not commonly been identified. 2. With material from 1993 to 2003, we test the hypothesis that the reproduction of Finnish northern goshawks Accipiter gentilis (L.) is bottom-up limited by habitat composition, especially in situations where the density of their main prey (grouse) is low. Special emphasis was placed on identifying the mechanism(s) behind potential habitat effects. 3. While laying date and large-scale variation in the main prey density (but not habitat composition) were related to the number of eggs goshawks laid, small-scale differences in alternative prey density between different territories later influenced how many young were fledged via the mechanism of habitat-dependent partial-brood loss. As a result of this mechanism, a difference in nestling condition also arose between goshawk territories with differing habitat compositions. 4. As the relative proportions of different landscape elements in a given landscape is a function of large-scale differences in geomorphology and land use, this means that the reproductive performance of goshawks as averaged over larger scales can be understood correctly only in respect to the fact that habitat gradients differ across landscapes. 5. In addition to being one of the first papers identifying the mechanism of partial brood loss as being primarily responsible for the habitat-specific differences in the production of young, this study further illustrates the need to identify small-scale mechanisms to correctly understand the large-scale patterns of reproductive performance in territorial species.

It has been suggested that optimal food supply by parents and begging effort of nestlings are context dependent, and we here test some predictions of this hypothesis. House sparrow (Passer domesticus) nestlings were experimentally fed with a pharmacological appetitive stimulant (cyproheptadine) that increases nestling demands, and explore its effect on nestling growth (i.e. body mass and tarsus length), which can be considered as the net payoff of inflated and costly offspring demand. As assumed by the experimental protocol, nestlings with an exaggerated demand were preferentially fed by parents. In accordance with the hypothesis, net benefits in terms of growth were mainly detected in first breeding attempt of parents that successfully reared three broods. Because costs associated with parental feeding should be lower for first breeding attempts and for parents of higher phenotypic quality (those able to successfully rear three clutches), our results provide to our knowledge, the first experimental evidence supporting a dynamic role of costs of food supply affecting net payoff of offspring demands, which may help to understand the mechanisms allowing the evolutionary equilibrium between intensities of offspring begging and parental provisioning.Both feeding and begging for food are costly activities for offspring and parents respectively. Rewards of such behaviours in terms of food receiving and reproductive success should vary depending on ecological conditions (i.e. food availability for offspring and physical condition of parents). Here we pharmacologically exaggerated appetitive of house sparrows (Passer domesticus) nestlings and explore its effect on parental behaviour and on nestling growth (i.e. body mass and tarsus length). The expected benefits were mainly detected for first breeding attempts and only in nests of adults that were able to rear two more broods, that is, when costs of feeding the offspring by adults are lower. Our results provide to our knowledge, the first experimental evidence supporting dynamic outcomes of offspring demands and parental provisioning, which is essential for understanding the evolution of parent-offspring communication.",10.1007/s00265-016-2115-1,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In vitro digestibility, protein and ash levels of crop contents were 24-34% lower, while fibre content was 20% higher in winter than in the other seasons. Marked annual variation in the yield of mountain birch shoots and catkins were registered. The yield of shoots showed a gradual 4-yr increase followed by a marked decline in the following year. The percentage of different birch parts in late winter crop contents, and their chemical composition, varied significantly between years. Annual variation in winter diet composition as well as the fat level of grouse were to a large extent related to food abundance. Multiple regression equations showed that 92-96% of the observed variability in grouse fat levels was accounted for by the yield of mountain birch shoots and catkins. In spring, large annual variation in species composition of the food was related to variation in the in vitro digestibility. This food quality parameter was positively correlated with the size of the fat reserves of breeding females, which in turn was related to breeding success, indicating that maternal nutrition affects Willow Grouse reproduction. However, the two worst grouse breeding years were associated with declines in the populations of small mammals, so that predator ""switching"" may have contributed to the low grouse reproductive success.

If the Goshawk reduces the number of corvids robbing grouse nests, there should be a larger proportion of grouse females with broods near Goshawk nests during late summer. We compared the proportion of grouse females with the broods observed in wildlife-triangle counts, which were performed along a 12-km-long equilateral triangle in relation to distance from a successful Goshawk nest. Where Goshawks had nested inside a triangle, the proportion of Black Grouse females with a brood was 20 % higher than in situations where a Goshawk had nested 2-3 km away from the center of the triangle. On the other hand, the number of adult Black Grouse rose as the distance from the Goshawk nest increased, but this pattern did not hold with chick abundance. No distance effect was found for Capercaillie.

It has been shown that small passerines can counteract variability of food resources by actively regulating their body reserves through an increase of mass. However, it was recently found that, with unpredictable food availability, quails and hooded crows do not adopt an adaptive fattening strategy but lose mass. At present, little is known about the effects of food unpredictability on other body parameters, such as immune functions and blood variables. In this study, we analysed the responses to food abundance and unpredictability by performing two experiments of controlled food administration in the magpie, a passerine intermediate in size between small passerines and crows. Body mass, leukocyte abundance, haematocrit, spleen mass and immune reaction to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) were assessed during a 15-d period. In the first experiment, the food release was predictable (same amount each day), but the quantity of food varied in four groups of birds. Low food levels induced a greater decrease in mass. In the second experiment, the same average quantity of food was supplied, but with predictable or unpredictable (random) schedules. As previously reported for crows and quails, magpies did not adaptively increase their mass in response to food unpredictability. Furthermore, there was a decrease of haematocrit and immune response to PHA. It appears that a body mass decrease in the magpie can be induced by a reduction of either food abundance or food predictability, and it is accompanied by a worsening of health state.",10.1016/S1146-609X(02)01154-2,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Removal of native conifer trees, especially juniper (Juniperus spp.), is occurring across the Great Basin of the western U.S. to support declining sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) habitats and associated wildlife species, such as greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). One justification for conifer removal is that it may improve survival of sagebrush-associated wildlife by reducing the abundance of avian predators. However, the relationship between conifer expansion and predator distributions has not been explicitly evaluated. Further, although structural characteristics of habitat are important for generalist predators, overall prey abundance may also affect habitat use by predators. We examined habitat use of common ravens (Corvus corax) and red-tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), two generalist predators whose populations are increasing in western North America, to variation in structural characteristics and prey distributions in sagebrush habitat that has experienced conifer expansion. Structural characteristics of habitat were important predictors of habitat use for both ravens and red-tailed hawks, whereas measures of prey abundance were unimportant for both species likely because generalist predators can use a wide variety of food resources. Ravens, but not red-tailed hawks, responded positively to increasing cover of juniper and the probability of habitat use was highest (> 0.95) where juniper cover within 100 m was > 20%. Habitat use by red-tailed hawks, but not ravens, was greater near cliffs but was not associated with juniper cover. Our study suggests that the removal of conifer in similar environments may lower the probability of habitat use for ravens, a common predator with significant impacts on many prey species. Therefore, we suggest conifer removal may improve sage-grouse reproductive success and survival depending on responses to conifer removal from other predators. Our results may be reflective of similar changes in rangeland ecosystems around the world undergoing expansion of conifer and other woody vegetation. Though species identities differ from sagebrush habitats, generalist avian predators in other habitats may have similar relationships with structural resources.",10.1371/journal.pone.0286478,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many predators feed primarily on rodents when the densities of rodents are high and change to alternative prey (eggs or young birds) when the main prey populations decrease. Aims During a 3-year study, predation on an artificial nest was related to population dynamics of small mammals in coniferous and deciduous forests in the Tatra Mountains (western Carpathians). Methods Small mammals were captured using the live traps. In deciduous forest habitats, we placed 36 traps and, in coniferous forest habitats, we placed 18 traps. In total, 174 artificial nests imitating broods of hazel grouse (Tetrastes bonansia) were located randomly in both types of forest habitat between 2012 and 2014. Predators of the artificial nests were identified by camera-traps at 87 nests. Key results Most of the artificial nests were lost to predation by mammals. The most numerous species of rodents in both types of forest habitat were the yellow-necked mouse (Apodemus flavicollis) and the bank vole (Myodes glareolus). A significant decrease in the number of rodents was followed by a considerable increase of predation on artificial nests. There were no significant differences in the rates of predation between the two forest-habitat types. Conclusions Our results support the alternative prey hypothesis and suggest that the breeding success of ground-nesting birds in the forests of the Tatra Mountains varies strongly from year to year, depending on the abundance of rodents. Implications Increasing of rodents' density may result in lower predation pressure on eggs of ground-nesting birds.

Pairs composed of 2 adults produced more fledged young than did pairs composed of 2 yearlings, but clutch size and date of clutch initiation were similar in the 2 groups.

Previous studies have shown a relationship between the date of snowmelt and reproductive success in the Pyrenean ptarmigan. It is well established that birds laying early in the breeding season have higher reproductive success, but the specific mechanism for this relationship is debated. We present an explicative model of the relationship between snowmelt date and breeding success mediated by food quality for grouse in alpine environments. From microhistological analyses of 121 faecal samples collected during three years in the Canigou Massif (Eastern Pyrenees), and the assessment of the chemical composition of the main dietary components, we estimated the potential quality of individual diets. Potential dietary quality was correlated with free-urate faecal N, a proxy of the digestible protein content ingested by ptarmigan, and both were correlated with phenological stage of consumed plants, which in turn depends on snowmelt date. Our findings suggest that the average snowmelt date is subject to a strong interannual variability influencing laying date. In years of early snowmelt, hens benefit from a longer period of high quality food resources potentially leading to a higher breeding success. On the contrary, in years of late snowmelt, hens begin their breeding period in poorer nutrient condition because the peaks of protein content of their main food items are delayed with respect to laying date, hence reducing breeding performance.

Hen harriers Circus cyaneus can reduce the numbers of red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus available for shooting. We conducted a supplementary feeding experiment on Langholm Moor, UK, in 1998 and 1999 to determine whether feeding hen harriers could reduce the numbers of red grouse killed. The experiment was done at two distinct stages of the breeding cycle: prior to incubation (spring experiment) and after hatching (summer experiment). In spring, Langholm Moor was divided into two areas, one with food and one without. In summer a number of birds were provided with food in both areas. 2. Providing harriers with food in spring had no significant effect on the breeding density of males or females, although feeding was associated with an increase in density on one area in one year. In addition, over the 2 years of the experiment, there was no evidence that feeding led to more chicks returning to breed in subsequent years. Fed harriers had larger clutches but did not lay earlier than unfed birds. 3. A minimum of 78% of the radio-tagged grouse that were killed during spring were killed by raptors. The mortality rates of adult grouse did not differ between the two areas or between the two years despite the availability of supplementary food and the large differences in harrier breeding density between areas. We infer that other raptors were responsible for much of the predation of adult grouse. 4. During the nestling period, female harriers took supplementary food at a higher rate than males. Females that were fed during the spring took more supplementary food in summer than those fed only during summer. Fed birds did not deliver more food overall to nests than those not provided with food. 5. Both male and female harriers at nests where supplementary food was available caught grouse chicks at a lower rate than harriers at nests not provided with food. For both years combined, fed harriers delivered on average 0.5 grouse chicks to their nests per 100 h, compared with 3.7 grouse chicks delivered to nests without supplementary food. 6. We estimated that feeding all harriers at Langholm would cost approximately [pnd]11 000 per annum. In both 1998 and 1999, the numbers of grouse chicks lost were 10 times higher than expected from harrier predation rates. Some other, unknown, factor had a strong influence on grouse chick survival in these years. Feeding some of the breeding harriers did not lead to an increase in grouse density at Langholm. 7. The results suggest that supplementary feeding may provide a useful tool in reducing the number of grouse chicks taken by harriers. Further experiments are now necessary to see under what conditions this reduced predation will lead to increases in grouse density.",10.1046/j.0021-8901.2001.00683.x,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data were collected annually using two standardized aerial surveys and follow-up foot surveys. Aerial surveys were conducted during the early incubation period (late April) to determine occupancy and nesting activities and late in the nestling period (late July) to count fledglings and determine nesting success. All aerial surveys were conducted using a Bell 206B Jet Ranger helicopter with one or two experienced observers and an experienced wildlife pilot. Aerial surveys were the most time- and cost-efficient means to survey the 1800-km2 study area. Average flight time during late April surveys was 12.8 flight hr (over 3 d) and during late July was 5.3 flight hr on 1 d. Duration of surveys depended on nesting activities. Foot surveys were useful for making longer observations in areas where territory occupancy could not be determined during aerial surveys. Annual occupancy rates averaged 83%. Laying rates, success rates, and overall population productivity varied significantly over the study period. Fledgling production varied greatly over the 12-yr period from a low of 9 fledglings in 1994 to a high of 70 fledglings in 1999. Laying rates, mean brood size, and overall population productivity were significantly correlated with abundance of cyclic snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) and Willow Ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) populations. Cyclic prey did not influence occupancy rates. Most territories were occupied more than 8 yr, but four remained vacant throughout the study. Productivity varied greatly among nesting territories.

In order to better understand the role of these potential changes in community structure on an alternative prey species, willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus, we analyzed nine years of population census data from SE Norway to investigate how community interactions affected their population dynamics. The ptarmigan populations showed no declining trend during the study period, and annual variations corresponded with marked periodic small rodent peaks and declines. Population growth and breeding success were highly correlated, and both demographic variables were influenced by an interaction between red fox and small rodents. Red foxes affected ptarmigan negatively only when small rodent abundance was low, which is in accordance with the alternative prey hypothesis. Our results confirm the important role of red fox predation in ptarmigan dynamics, and indicate that if small rodent cycles are disrupted, this may lead to decline in ptarmigan and other alternative prey species due to elevated predation pressure.",10.1371/journal.pone.0197289,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the mechanisms underlying responses of predators to climate change remain poorly understood. Climate can influence fitness parameters of predators either through reduced reproduction or survival following adverse weather conditions, or via changes in the population dynamics of their main prey. Here, we combined three overlapping long-term datasets on the breeding density and parameters of a rodent-specialist predator, the rough-legged buzzard Buteo lagopus, its main prey population dynamics and climate variables, collected in subarctic areas of Finland and Norway, to assess the impact of changing climate on the predator reproductive response. Rough-legged buzzards responded to ongoing climate change by advancing their laying date (0.1 d yr(-1) over the 21 yr of the study period), as a consequence of earlier snowmelt. However, we documented for the same period a decrease in breeding success, which principally resulted from an indirect effect of changes in the dynamics of their main prey, i.e. grey-sided voles Microtus oeconomus, and not from the expected negative effect of unfavorable weather conditions during the brood-rearing period on nestling survival. Additionally, we showed the striking impact of autumn and winter weather conditions on vole population growth rates in subarctic ecosystems, with a strong positive correlation between mean snow depth in autumn and winter and both winter and summer population growth rates. Our results highlighted that, in northern ecosystems, ongoing climate change has the potential to impact specialist predator species through two mechanistic linkages, which may in the long-run, threaten the viability of their populations, and lead to potential severe cascading trophic effects at the ecosystem level.",10.1111/ecog.01024,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The strength and direction of relationships between behavioral and life-history traits may however vary according to environmental conditions, where fluctuating selection acting on behavioral traits contributes to the maintenance of personality differences. We explored sources of variation in Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) boldness and investigated how temporal variation in the abundance of a main prey (lemmings) influences the relationship between fox boldness and reproductive success. We measured the behavioral reaction of individuals when escaping after handling, as an indicator of their boldness. We obtained 70 measurements from 42 individuals during two years of low lemming abundance and 2 years of high lemming abundance and assessed fox litter size as an indicator of reproductive success. First, individual characteristics (age, sex, mass) did not affect Arctic fox boldness, while individual identity generated variation in boldness. Next, we found that during years of low lemming density, individuals behaving boldly had more pups than those behaving less boldly, suggesting boldness may provide an advantage when lemmings are scarce by increasing hunting success or allowing access to alternative resources. However, all individuals tended to show high levels of boldness when lemming density was high, and all produced large litters. Temporal variation in the abundance of a main prey might therefore influence the relation between boldness and reproductive success of a predator, and if individuals consistently differ in their level of boldness, fluctuating selection could contribute to the maintenance of personality.Significance statementEffects of boldness on Arctic fox reproductive success: lemming abundance matters! When lemmings are scarce, foxes showing bold behavior have more pups than foxes showing less bold behavior. This highlights that under low prey availability, boldness may bring short-term benefits to predators, potentially because it allows to acquire more food. When lemmings are abundant, however, all foxes produce as many pups. This shows that environmental conditions such as prey abundance can influence the relation between behavior and reproductive success in a predator. Studying the context-dependency of relationships between behavior and reproductive success is critical to better understand ecological and evolutionary consequences of environmental change.",10.1007/s00265-023-03342-6,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mistiming breeding activities in environments with constrained breeding windows may have severe fitness costs due to reduced opportunities for repeated breeding attempts. Therefore, species occurring in alpine environments may be particularly vulnerable. We studied fitness consequences of timing of breeding in an alpine-endemic species, the white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucura), to investigate its influence on chick survival. We estimated phenological mismatch by measuring plant and arthropods used by ptarmigan in relation to their timing of breeding. We monitored 120 nests and 67 broods over a three-year period (2013-2015) at three alpine study sites in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. During this same period, we actively monitored food resource abundance in brood-use areas to develop year and site-specific resource phenology curves. We developed several mismatch indices from these curves that were then fit as covariates in mark-recapture chick survival models. A correlation analysis between seasonal changes in arthropod and food plant abundance indicated that a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was likely the best predictor for food available to hens and chicks. A survival model that included an interaction between NDVI mismatch and chick age received strong support and indicated young chicks were more susceptible to mismatch than older chicks. We provide evidence that individual females of a resident alpine species can be negatively affected by phenological mismatch. Our study focused on individual females and did not examine if phenological mismatch was present at the population level. Future work in animal populations occurring in mountain systems focusing on a combination of both individual- and population-level metrics of mismatch will be beneficial.",10.1002/ece3.5290,,JME,Phasianidae,Insect availability,Reproductive success,Yes,Incomplete insect data; didn't assess insect availability as a predictor for repro success,2013-2015,Southern Rocky Mountains A) Mt.

One group received artificial food from a nunnery prior to incubation whereas the other fed on natural food. This difference in the birds' nutritional history allowed us to assess the effects of food on reproduction. Laying occurred between mid-April and early June, with a peak at the end of April or early May. Eggs were laid around noon. Adult females produced one clutch per year. Clutch size averaged 7.4 eggs (4-11). Incubation lasted 24-25 days. We observed a higher nesting success (67.7%) than reported for other eared pheasants. Provisioning had no significant effect on the timing of clutch initiation or nesting success, and a weak effect on egg size and clutch size (explaining 8.2% and 9.1% of the observed variation, respectively). These results were attributed to the observation that the unprovisioned birds had not experienced local food shortage before laying, despite spending more time feeding and less time resting than the provisioned birds. Nest-site selection by the pheasants was non-random with respect to environmental variables. Rock-cavities with an entrance averaging 0.32 m2 in size and not deeper than 1.5 m were greatly preferred as nest-sites. The birds were also more likely to place their nests in denser high-scrub and closer to streams. In the study area, the low availability of both cliff habitats and high-scrub patches suggested a limitation of sites suitable for nesting, which could be reflected in the between-year re-use of nest-sites (8.9%) and intraspecific nest parasitism (3.8%). Despite the apparent preference for certain nest-site variables, we found no effect of these on clutch fate, suggesting that the risk of nest predation was random.",10.1046/j.1474-919X.2003.00204.x,,JME,Phasianidae,No,,No,Plant abundance; supplementary feeding ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies of common eiders have shown a positive relationship between nest success and driftwood cover. Our observations led us to hypothesize that cover does not enhance nest success when mammalian predators are present. To evaluate nest cover selection in common eiders, we examined five years of nesting data to determine the interactions between the probability of nest activity and the amount of driftwood cover in the presence of avian versus mammalian predators. Most common eider nests were surrounded by low (40%) or moderate (38%) driftwood cover. Nest failure rates were high (32%-95%), and arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus), alone or with polar bears (Ursus maritimus), appeared to be more destructive than glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus) to eider nests. Logistic regression was used to model common eider nest activity associated with driftwood cover and predators. When glaucous gulls were the only predators, more driftwood cover consistently increased the probability of nest activity. But when foxes were present, nest activity consistently decreased with increasing cover. Our models support our I observations that nest cover was beneficial to eiders when glaucous gulls alone were predators. Driftwood cover may be most important for the thermal and structural protection it offers, rather than for the camouflage it provides. The energetic benefit provided by driftwood windbreaks coupled with the common eider's behavioral response of decreased nest attendance, or increased exposure to avian depredation of nests as energy reserves are depleted during incubation, provides an explanatory mechanism for our model results.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We documented a link between water availability, predation risk, and reproductive success in a goose species (Chen caerulescens atlantica) inhabiting an Arctic environment where water is not considered a limited commodity. To reach water sources during incubation recesses, geese nesting in mesic tundra (low water availability) must move almost four times as far from their nest than those nesting in wetlands, which reduced their ability to defend their nest against predators and led to a higher predation rate. Nesting success was improved in high rainfall years due to increased water availability, and more so for geese nesting in the low water availability habitat. Likewise, nesting success was improved in years where the potential for evaporative water loss (measured by the atmospheric water vapor pressure) was low, presumably because females had to leave their nest less often to drink. Females from water-supplemented nests traveled a shorter distance to drink, and their nesting success was enhanced by 20% compared to the control. This shows that water availability and rainfall can have a strong effect on predator prey dynamics and that changes in precipitation brought by climate change could have an impact on some Arctic species through a top-down effect.",10.1890/08-0215.1,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Responses of martens included reduced population density, enlarged home ranges, lower ovulation rates in females aged 1 and 2 years, reduced production of young, dispersal of formerly resident adults during the 2nd year of scarce food, and cannibalism. Dispersal of residents resulted in an unexpectedly high trapping success in 1983, suggesting that fur returns do not reflect changing population levels for marten. Male body weights did not differ among years but females weighed more in early winter of scarce food years compared to the same period when food was abundant (P .ltoreq. 0.01). Less mesenteric and renal fat was found on all martens during the 1st winter of scarce food (P .ltoreq. 0.001). We believe that a reservoir strategy for marten management can be an effective tool, but when food is low managers must account for larger home ranges and possible dispersal of residents by reducing harvest quotas.",10.2307/3801748,,JME,No,No,,No,predator study,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Populations of main prey fluctuated in a cyclic manner with three years between peak densities. The nesting success of buzzards averaged 1.7 fledglings per nesting attempt and the brood size averaged 2.2 fledglings per brood. The nesting rate (no. of active nests per number of occupied territories) and the productivity rate (no. of chicks for all territories) positively correlated with the abundance of Microtus voles in the current spring but not with the abundance of grouse. The Alternative Prey Hypothesis (APH) predicts that, in the years when the main prey species decline, generalist predators can shift their diet to alternative prey and thus cause its decline. The Shared Predation Hypothesis (SPH) states that all important prey species, including alternative prey, are under high hunting pressure when the density of predators is high. The predation rate (the combination of numerical response and previously studied functional response) of Microtus voles by buzzards was positively correlated with the densities of these voles in the current spring, whereas the predation rate of grouse tended to peak one year after peak densities of Microtus voles. Therefore, our results appear to support APH rather than SPH and indicate that predation by buzzards may dampen population cycles of main prey (voles) but amplify population fluctuations of grouse.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We maintained captive male red-legged partridges, Alectoris rufa, under regulated food shortage until they reached 85% of their initial body mass. Controls were provided with food ad libitum. After food shortage, experimental birds had lower androgen and higher corticosterone levels than controls. The condition dependence in androgen levels suggests that androgen-mediated signals could be indicating general nutritional state rather than immune function specifically.

Low temperatures affect insectivorous bats by increasing the energy required for homeothermy while roosting and by decreasing the energy available due to lower activity of insect prey. Low temperatures may be particularly costly to pregnant and lactating bats because these experience greater energetic demands due to gestation and milk production. The use of heterothermy may increase gestation length and decrease milk production. In a 2-year study of female pallid bats (Antrozous pallidus) in central Oregon, I found that lower spring temperatures in 1991 than in 1990 were correlated with a higher percentage of nonreproductive females, delayed parturition dates, reduced synchrony of parturition, and lower body mass of lactating females. Overall reproductive success was probably lower in 1991 as a result of females not reproducing or of juvenile mortality. In 1991 , both females and juveniles were probably in poorer condition prior to migrating and entering hibernation. The effects of temperature on reproduction in this ground-foraging bat are similar to those documented for aerial insectivorous bats.

In this study, the presence of a grouse hen with a brood in a landscape was used to indicate habitat-related breeding success. We combined the locations of 938 black grouse (Tetrao tetrix), 388 capercaillie (T. urogallus), and 917 hazel grouse (Tetrastes bonasia) broods after the breeding season in mid-August with landscape data by employing Geographic Information System and grouse data derived from the Finnish wildlife triangle censuses conducted during 1997-2004. Two large study areas with different landscape structures, northern forest-mire area and southern cultivated area, were selected for the investigation. The presence of grouse broods was positively related to the amount of old coniferous mixed forest. Grouse broods may prefer this forest habitat because of a rich understorey cover and a rich bilberry field layer offering a diversity of insects as food. Broods had a strong positive response to the amount of forest habitat. The effect of forest fragmentation on the broods' distribution did not increase even with decreasing forest habitat. We suggest that there are several ecological causes for the observed spatial correlations. Predation on nests and broods by generalist predators is presumably high in human-modified open and semi-open landscapes. Against our expectations, the effect of landscape composition on grouse broods was more marked in the northern than in the southern study area, most likely because predator populations are more food-regulated in the north. This finding supports the alternative prey hypothesis. Further, large drained and reforested peatland mire areas had a negative impact on grouse broods in the north.

Michael",2016,Predation and reduced grazing interact to reduce recruitment and population growth in Black Brant,Condor,118,2,"Dynamics of avian populations may be governed by a complex interaction between immediate effects of predation and longer-term trophic feedbacks between individuals and their foods. We used a long-term study of uniquely marked Black Brant geese (Branta bernicla nigricans) to estimate recruitment into the breeding population. We related recruitment to nest success, which directly affects recruitment 2 to 3 years later. We also assessed similarly time-lagged relationships between recruitment and number of nests in the colony, a measure of local density, and pre-fledging and first-year survival, the latter of which is strongly influenced by growth conditions and food availability for young of the year. We assessed relationships between number of recruits and explanatory variables in 2 sets of models, which either included or excluded a linear trend across years in numbers of recruits. The best-performing models in each model set explained a substantial proportion of the variation in numbers of recruits 2 to 3 years later (85 and 78% in the 2 model sets, respectively). First-year survival was an important predictor of number of recruits in both sets of models, whereas nest success was important only in models lacking a trend across years. Number of nests in the colony had a relatively weak negative association with number of recruits. First-year survival reflects a lagged response to earlier nest-predation events. Reduced grazing during predation events can result in loss of grazing lawns and thus reduced growth rates of future cohorts of goslings, which are regulated by food abundance and density of broods. Our finding that recruitment is insufficient to maintain the breeding population results from both direct effect of predation on nests, primarily by Arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus), and longer-term indirect effects of such predation on first-year survival of Black Brant.",10.1650/CONDOR-15-109.1,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

While many studies have evaluated the environmental, behavioral, or physiological correlates of GCs and their effects on reproductive performances, further work is needed to clarify the relationship between GCs and fitness. Assessing the effects of increased GC levels on specific behaviors of breeding animals should improve our understanding of how GCs affect parental care. In this experimental study, we measured the effects of an experimental increase in corticosterone (CORT, the main avian GC) levels on the behavior of free-living male Ad,lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) within the colony, their reproductive output, and the indirect consequences of both on the behavior of their partners. We show that increased CORT levels in males decreased their foraging time at sea while increased their attendance at the nest, although their attentiveness toward the nest itself decreased. In addition, treated males spent more time on comfort behaviors (e.g., preening), vocalizing, and engaging in positive social interactions relative to controls. Treatment further affected the behavior of their partners, but not chick begging and feeding rates. Penguins with increased CORT levels also exhibited decreased reproductive output. Previous studies of Ad,lie penguins in different life history stages and environmental conditions suggest that the consequences of CORT treatment on reproductive performance are context-dependent. In addition to the potential delay in the effects of increased CORT levels on reproduction, this context dependence should be taken into account when studying the behavior of free-living animals in relation to stress-inducing situations.",10.1007/s00265-014-1685-z,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prey species can optimize feeding behavior and escape from predators based on mobility conditioned by body proportions. With age, mobility capacity increases and individuals are more efficient in finding resources and safety (e.g., food and refuge). Birds' mobility is driven by the dimensions, of the head and torso, as well as the extremities and flight feathers. To assess the relationship between body traits and to understand how body proportions are organized in wild Red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa), we used biometric data from nearly 14,000 individuals, obtained during a long-term study (1988-2011) on a wild population.ResultsWe used GLMs and regressions to model the relationship between body mass and the size of body parts. We found that wing length was the morphological part best explained by other body trait measures. Wing length models were better predictors in juveniles than in adults and in females than in males. Wing length and feather length, mass and total length are the most strongly related parts; mass and wing length, total length and feather length are moderately related. The association between mass and wing length is intermediated by feather length and total length.ConclusionsSocial inclusion, feeding and predator evasion may be affected by body structure intermediated by mobility and health. Our results suggest that proportions of the body, extremities and flight feathers drive mobility which is intimately associated with ecology, biological efficiency, health and physical optimization. Our findings showed that wing size was strongly allied to other body part measurements, enhancing the importance of body structure conformation for flight.

Ptarmigan species Lagopus spp., and especially Rock Ptarmigan L. mutus, were the Gyr Falcons' most important prey and constituted more than 90% of the prey biomass. A 21-fold difference in ptarmigan abundance was found across Falcon breeding territories. However, this great variation in prey availability corresponded to only about a 10% shift in Gyr Falcon diet across territories, suggesting that the Falcons were reluctant or unable to compensate for declining ptarmigan availability by using alternative prey categories. Gyr Falcons did not respond functionally to microtine rodent abundance. Their diets were unaffected by a peak in the microtine rodent population cycle when Norwegian Lemmings Lemmus lemmus occurred in high numbers in the study area. Gyr Falcons responded numerically to their prey in two ways. First, there was a reproductive response with a significant relationship between the number of chicks fledged and the number of ptarmigan in the breeding territories. Secondly, although the Gyr Falcons did not utilize microtines as prey, there was a relationship between the microtine rodent abundance and the number of pairs that attempted to breed each year. This could be a result of an indirect community interaction, assuming that other predators switched from ptarmigan to microtines as prey, which could have had a positive effect on the breeding performance of the Gyr Falcons. The Gyr Falcons acted as true specialist predators, and their narrow food niche probably reflected a general lack of suitable alternative prey in the study area.",10.1111/j.1474-919x.2005.00436.x,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eight quail were maintained within their thermoneutral zone (TNZ) at 32.6 +/- 0.2 degrees C, and eight below their lower critical temperature (T-lc) at 12.7 +/- 3.0 degrees C. All quail entered hypothermia upon food deprivation, even quail kept within their TNZ. Body temperature (T-b) decreased more (38.36 +/- 0.53 degrees C vs. 39.57 +/- 0.57 degrees C), body mass (m(b)) loss was greater (21.0 +/- 7.20 g vs. 12.8 +/- 2.62 g), and the energy saved by using hypothermia was greater (25.18-45.01% vs. 7.98-28.06%) in low the T-a treatment than in TNZ treatment. Interestingly, the depth of hypothermia was positively correlated with m(b) loss in the low T-a treatment, but not in TNZ treatment. Our data support H-3, that both thermoregulatory costs and body energy reserves are proximate cues for entry into hypothermia in quail. This outcome is not surprising below the T-lc. However, the quail kept at their TNZ also responded to food deprivation by entering hypothermia with no apparent dependence on m(b) loss. Therefore inputs, other than thermoregulatory costs and body condition, must serve as cues to enter hypothermia. Consequently, we address the role that tissue sparing may play in the physiological 'decision' to employ hypothermia. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The results are summarized in Figs 3 and 4 and Tabs 1-4. The Buzzard population appears to be stable. Young production, though probably sufficient to make the population self-sustaining, was lower than reported by Holstein (1956) from studies conducted 50 years ago: 1.1 full-grown young per pair, with 66% of the pairs raising young, compared with Holstein's data showing 1.6 young per pair and a nesting success of 83%. The main reason seems to be poor feeding conditions in present-day agricultural areas. Pairs in farmland raised fewer young than pairs in uncultivated areas, and farmland Buzzards tend to forage more in woods today than they did 15-20 years ago. One indication of this is that breeding success was high in years following a season of rich beech-mast production, probably mediated through increased population levels of forest-living rodents. The Sparrowhawk population initially rose but has declined again since the late 70s. This trend is overlaid by fluctuations which appear caused mainly by the severity of the winter. The proportion of juvenile-plumaged females is particularly low after cold winters. As in the Buzzard, young production was higher in pairs breeding in uncultivated areas than in farmland pairs, but generally young production increased during the later part of the study period; food shortage, hence, seems not to be the cause of the negative population trend. Instead, reduction of suitable nesting habitat by felling of spruce stands may be partly responsible. The number of Goshawk pairs has declined steadily since a peak in 1980. Shooting of (mainly immature) Goshawks at Pheasant release sites may be a major cause; of 57 recovered Goshawks ringed during the present study, 13 were reported shot. The number of breeding Honey Buzzard pairs in the study area is small and fluctuates widely. The number of pairs is negatively correlated with precipitation during May, but - contrary to expectation - breeding success is not. In fact, the number of young per pair was above average in the three particularly bad seasons 1980, 1981 and 1983. Perhaps Honey Buzzards in Denmark are not so dependent on wasp nest availability for feeding as are Honey Buzzards in Central Europe.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Other important prey included reindeer (Rang fer tarandus), mountain hare (Lepus timidus) and microtine rodents. The Golden Eagles managed to maintain a relatively broad food niche, despite an environment with low prey diversity.

Yet a key remaining challenge is to understand how changing prey biomass within foraging habitats could affect predator foraging success. Quantifying this using observed prey information is challenging given a paucity of synoptic data. Here, we investigated whether prey biomass from a mechanistic model, could provide useful predictions of pre-breeding arrival body mass of macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) from Marion Island, a standard metric of predator foraging success, measured over a 20 -year period. In testing this, we used a spatially iterative correlation approach between predicted prey biomass and observed penguin arrival body mass, allowing likely foraging areas to emerge in regions most frequently associated with significant correlations. We then considered whether the distribution of these emergent foraging areas is consistent with tracking-derived foraging distributions for this species and island. Our results indicated emergent foraging areas where prey biomass was most often correlated with arrival body mass were located within expected and observed foraging ranges. Further, variability in prey biomass, within these emergent foraging areas provided reasonable predictions of annual penguin arrival body mass and outperformed metrics of primary production within these foraging areas. Our findings demonstrate that mechanistic models can provide biologically meaningful representations of difficult-to-observe prey, and can predict predator foraging success.

On average, 57% of the chicks died within the first month of life. Mortality was highest during the first 3 weeks, coinciding with the period when chicks feed almost exclusively on insects, depend heavily on their mother for maintaining body warmth, and cannot fly well. Predation was by far the most important proximate cause of mortality, accounting for 90% of all observed losses. Only 7% of the losses could be ascribed to direct effects of cold and wet weather, all recorded during the first 8 days of life. However, because predation losses were also quite high during and immediately after heavy rainfalls, adverse weather probably predisposed the chicks to mammalian predation. Most chicks were killed by mustelids, mainly pine martens; low numbers of red fox due to sarcoptic mange probably explains the low proportion taken by this predator. Among known predation losses (N = 40), goshawks accounted for a minimum of 25%. Chick mortality during the first month varied markedly (29%-83%) among the three years.

The two populations remaining were confined to Ireland's industrial cutaway peat bogs. One of these populations was deemed viable. In 1996, the National Parks and Wildlife Service of Ireland and the Irish Grey Partridge Conservation Trust established a conservation project to prevent the extirpation of this population. In this paper, we explore the impact of each management factor on two key demographic response variables: chick survival rates and the number of breeding pairs. The numbers of linear metres of nesting strips had the most significantly positive effect on spring pairs, followed by the total number of supplementary food hoppers and the total hectares of brood-rearing and over-winter cover. Counterintuitively, encounters with Hen Harriers (Circus cyaneus) did not negatively affect chick survival or the number of spring pairs. While we cannot rule out the contribution of each explanatory variable, none had a statistically significant effect on chick survival, suggesting there may be locally confounding factors that our model could not capture. The weather conditions during the peak hatching period had a significant influence on chick survival, with the average maximum temperature observed in June having the strongest positive association with an increase of 1 degrees C in the average maximum temperature in June associated with an increase in chick survival of 9.4% on average.

Other European studies fitted into this picture, with a 10-year lag in each period. The onset of population decrease corresponded with a sharp decrease in chick survival mainly caused by reduced insect availability due to pesticide use. Several factors caused the continued decreasing numbers after 1970, such as decreased hatching success and an increased role of predation. Measures to restore partridge numbers should firstly focus on the main cause of population decline, that is, improve foraging conditions to increase chick survival rate. Next to creation of special partridge habitat, conventional agriculture offers good opportunities to improve foraging conditions.

The time lags were assumed to reflect the average age of sexual maturity in the raptor species. In southern Norway, however, subadult (two-year-old) goshawk hens occupied only 18-25% of territories where occupancy was not recorded in the preceding year, and there was no significant relationship between the proportion of subadults among recruits and grouse indices two years earlier. We argue that territory occupancy rates are not appropriate indices of total raptor population levels, but rather reflect the proportion of territorial pairs that attempt to nest. Because this depends on the body condition of the hens, fluctuations in other important winter resident prey species (most important for the goshawk) and winter weather (most important for the gyrfalcon) should also be addressed. During 1988-2006, the annual proportion of goshawk territories with recorded nesting attempts in southern Norway was most closely related to the preceding autumn's population indices of black grouse Tetrao tetrix and mountain hare Lepus timidus, whereas the annual proportion of gyrfalcon territories with observations of falcons or with confirmed breeding attempts in central Norway were best explained by population indices of willow grouse Lagopus lagopus and ptarmigan L. mutus from the previous autumn, and by December temperatures.

Both stressors were considered in our experiment in the simazine exposure and food availability to lizards (Eremias argus). The results revealed that starvation significantly reduced the lizard's energy reserve and native immune function, while the accumulation of simazine in the liver was significantly increased. Simazine caused oxidative stress in the liver of lizards, but oxidative damage only occurred in the starved lizards. Simazine also changed the energy reserves, native immune function and detoxification of well-fed lizards, while the starved lizards showed different sensitivity to simazine. Simazine or starvation treatment independently activated the lizard HPA axis, but co-treatment caused the HPA axis inhibition. Besides, according to the variations on amino acid neurotransmitters, corticosterone hormone and thermoregulatory behavior, we inferred that lizards in threatens take the appropriate strategy on energy investment and allocation through neural, endocrine and behavioral pathways to maximize benefits in dilemma. Energy allocation was necessary, while suppression on any physiological process comes at a cost that is detrimental to long-term individual fitness. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Providing supplementary food for pheasants throughout the spring has been shown to increase their breeding success, primarily through improving hen body condition. In a separate study, individually dosing hens with an anthelminthic in spring to reduce their parasitic worm burden has also been shown to increase their productivity in the wild. In a small-scale pilot study these two techniques were combined to test their efficacy as a means of treating free-living pheasants in spring without the need to catch individuals. The parasitic worms recorded were Heterakis gallinarum and Capillaria spp., both of which are found in the caecae. The results indicated that, in the absence of anthelminthic treatment, worm burden in pheasants increased rapidly between March and April, but in contrast, birds given anthelminthic treated grain had significantly lower worm burden during the same period. Therefore we suggest that this is an effective management technique for treating free-living pheasants in spring. Subsequently, an experiment was carried out to try to assess the best time to allow pheasants access to 'treated' grain in the wild in order to maximise its benefits. Hen pheasants in pens were exposed to infection from the soil.

R.",1963,"Population studies on red grouse, Lagopus lagopus scoticus (Lath.) in north-east Scotland",JOUR ANIMAL ECOL,32,-3,"Red grouse, many of them marked, were counted at regular intervals over 5 years. They showed a decline on the main study areas in northeast Scotland from a peak of about one breeding pair to 2 ha in 1957 and 1958 to about one pair to 6 ha in 1960, and an increase in 1961 to a peak similar to 1957. At all population densities, grouse numbers were apparently limited by the birds' behavior, probably in relation to their food supply. Different densities were associated with different behavior patterns, higher densities occurring when the birds were in family parties or flocks than when they were territorial. The number of breeders depended on the size of the territories. When all the breeding habitat was occupied, surplus birds without territories dispersed to marginal habitats where they died, mostly heavily parasitized and emaciated. Such birds are sometimes referred to as suffering from ""grouse disease"". The grouse population on the breeding area had three social components mated and unmated territory owners on optimum habitat, surplus non-territorial residents on marginal interspaces between territories, and surplus birds transient between other marginal areas where long-term survival was impossible but where grouse lived temporarily. Casualties among breeders were often replaced by previously surplus non-breeders, and mortality did not regulate the numbers of territory owners. Shooting exploited part of the surplus, and natural mortality mostly eliminated other birds that could not obtain or hold territories. Recruitment was adequate every year to stock the breeding areas to the levels permitted by the territory size next season. On the principal study areas there were 3 good breeding years with 4 or more young per pair in Aug., and 2 poor years with 2 or fewer young per pair. There was a significant correlation between clutch size, proportion hatching and chick survival over the 5 years; and good breeding success was correlated with good adult survival, heavy adult weights in Aug., and with 1:1 sex ratios in spring. Breeding success seems therefore to have been predetermined, and apparently it was not greatly influenced by the summer weather. There was no correlation between breeding success and spring numbers or the amount of previous dispersal. Annual changes in both spring numbers and breeding success were associated with changes in the main food in the previous winter. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors",10.2307/2598,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Altogether 1 206 animals were identified from the samples. Grouse species made up about 60% of the diet during the nestbuilding arid incubation periods and about 35% during the nestling period. The main grouse species were black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) and willow grouse (Lagopus lagopus), accounting for 22% and 19% of the spring diet and 12% and 9% of the summer diet, respectively. The percentage of grouse in the spring and summer diets decreased significantly from the 1960s to the 1980s, the main prey groups replacing them being corvids, squirrels and hares. The willow grouse is the preferred grouse species for the goshawk in this area, although this preference was abolished rapidly during the 1980s by the decrease in this species in the field. In contrast, feeding on the black grouse has increased since the 1960s, that on the capercaillie has remained stable, and that on the hazel grouse has varied considerably. The average clutch size of the goshawk (3.06, n=83) was significantly below the mean (3.53, n=393) during the 1980s in the whole province of Oulu (t=4.52, p lt 0.001). The clutch size and number of fledglings are positively correlated, with the relative abundance of grouse suggesting their key importance for the breeding success of the goshawk. The causes of the decline in grouse populations and the role of the goshawk in it are discussed.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quantifying these interactions typically requires the number of prey consumed by predators to be known, but prey size is often ignored. We hypothesized that rodent mandibles, which are routinely found in predatory bird pellets and mammalian scats, could be used to accurately determine prey size and thus estimate biomass consumed by Arctic predators. We used 1863 lemmings and voles from museum and field specimens collected across the North American Arctic to relate three measurements of the dentary bone and one on the molar toothrow with individual body mass. When species and location of specimens are known, our results suggest that the body mass of small rodents can be estimated with high precision using the dentary bone measurements (average R-2 ranging from 0.73 to 0.81), especially for lemmings and Microtus voles. Body mass can also be estimated with reasonable precision using the dentary bone measurements even when species or location was unknown (0.71 <= R-2 <= 0.80). Equations to convert mandible size to body mass are provided for site- and species-specific estimations. Geographic variations in the relationship between mandible size and body mass were found, suggesting potential effects of genetic isolation or interactions with the immediate environment on size. Using mandible measurements in prey remains allows more precise estimation of biomass consumed by predators, which is essential to quantify energy fluxes within ecosystems and examine resource partitioning among Arctic predators.",10.1111/jzo.12756,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lemmings (Dicrostonyx spp.) are important prey for Arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) and their annual population fluctuations drive fox reproduction, creating strongly linked predator-prey population cycles. Winter diet directly impacts Arctic fox reproductive success, but winter prey diversity on the tundra is low. Strategies such as using the marine environment to scavenge seals have allowed Arctic foxes to persist during years of low lemming abundance. However, warming winters have decreased snowpack quality, preventing lemmings from reaching their previous high abundances, which may reduce their impact on predator dynamics. We investigated Arctic fox dietary response to lemming abundance by reconstructing Arctic fox winter diet in the low Arctic. Next-generation sequencing of fecal DNA, from samples (n = 627) collected at dens in winters of 2011-2018, identified prey both from terrestrial and marine environments. Despite lemming cycle damping, Arctic foxes still increased lemming consumption during years of higher lemming abundance. Alternative prey such as marine resources were consumed more during years of low lemming abundance, with up to 45% of samples containing marine resources in low lemming years. In addition, Arctic foxes consumed high proportions of meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus), which may represent a new alternative prey, suggesting climate change may be creating new foraging opportunities. Changes in prey abundance illustrate how climate-caused disturbances arc altering Arctic food-web dynamics. Dietary flexibility and availability of alternative prey may become increasingly important for Arctic predators as the Arctic continues to change.",10.1093/jmammal/gyab115,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, descriptive studies of wild populations, most of them recent, are indicating that natural stresses can sometimes elicit resilience or flexible variation in adult life history traits, and that such plasticity can neutralize impacts of stress on fitness. Experiments, almost entirely in captivity, were not designed to detect such effects, and most were not suited for this purpose in that treatments did not mimic natural stresses, effects were seldom measured over the lifespan, and fitness consequences were rarely assessed. Future research needs to take into account that early stresses can elicit positive developmental responses, that the direction of effects of stresses can depend on their magnitude, and that a deficit in one fitness component can be compensated by modification of others. Different styles and types of research can shed more light on avian developmental plasticity by characterizing natural stresses more precisely, measuring their effects on diverse variables including fitness over the lifespan, conducting field experiments, and adopting a life history framework.",10.1642/AUK-14-244.1,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we examine relationships between two prey species that do not compete directly, the field vole Microtus agrestis, a common rodent with fluctuating populations, and the red grouse Lagopus lagopus scotica, a gamebird inhabiting open moorland, during a 27-year study on a moor in south-west Scotland. First, we test whether vole abundance was related to grouse density and demographic rates. Second, we test whether vole abundance was related to abundance indices of four common predators of both voles and grouse (red fox vulpes vulpes, weasel Mwtela nivalis, hen harrier Circus cyanew and common buzzard Buteo buteo). Third, we test whether these vole-grouse and vole-predator relationships differ in relation to grouse management, which includes the culling of foxes and weasels. We found no association between vole abundance and grouse densities, adult summer survival or nesting success. However, the ratio of young grouse per adult and the proportion of female grouse with broods in July were negatively associated with field vole abundance, suggesting increased predation of grouse chicks in years with high vole abundance. Fox indices showed a weak positive association with vole abundance when their numbers were not controlled, whilst weasel indices showed no relationship with voles. The numbers of breeding hen harriers and buzzards were also not associated with vole abundance, but the number of buzzard sightings was higher when voles were more plentiful. Our results are consistent with a negative interaction between field voles and red grouse chick survival in a pattern expected for apparent competition. Although the underlying mechanisms could not be disentangled, this interaction may be at least partly mediated by rodent-hunting raptors such as buzzards and, in periods without grouse management, foxes.",10.2981/wlb.00642,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The impact of hen harriers Circus cyaneus on red grouse Lagopus lagopus scoticus populations has received much attention. However, little has been done to model the population dynamics of the hen harrier alone. Such a model is needed to help inform the differing aims of conserving harriers and managing grouse moors, which serves as a reflection of human-wildlife conflicts around the globe.2. On Langholm estate in Scotland, intensive studies have resulted in harrier numbers being known without error. We fit a Bayesian population model to these data, using a super-population model to permit inference in the presence of demographic and environmental stochasticity and in the absence of observation error.3. Hen harriers have a straightforward life history. After fledging, juveniles show little natal site fidelity, often dispersing long distances into breeding areas rich in their preferred prey, the field vole Microtus agrestis and meadow pipit Anthus pratensis. Therefore, any increase in a local population is largely because of recruitment into the area as opposed to fledging success. Once birds have settled in an area, harriers are generally site faithful, with year-to-year survival depending, in part, on the density of meadow pipits.4. Our model suggests that temporal patterns in harrier numbers on managed grouse moors, in the absence of illegal persecution, are influenced by vole numbers, whereas meadow pipit density appears to have a limited effect.5. Synthesis and applications. Our modelling approach is a useful way to infer population processes, and the effects of the environment on these processes, for populations censused without error. When used to predict future harrier numbers under alternate management scenarios, our model indicates that harrier numbers on Langholm estate, Scotland, could be reduced without any direct human intervention if the estate can be managed in a way that reduces vole populations. In contrast, there appears little to gain from managing meadow pipit densities. If these conclusions apply to other harrier populations, then management to reduce vole numbers, while maintaining grouse densities, may help alleviate the conflict between conservationists and managers of grouse moors.",10.1111/j.1365-2664.2011.02013.x,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Goshawks feed mainly on forest grouse throughout the year in boreal forests but rely more on Ring-necked Pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) and hares (Lepus spp.) in mixed deciduous-coniferous forests in southern Fermoscandia. Breeding density of the goshawks varies from one-five pairs/100km(2), on average three pairs/100 km(2). Mean clutch size (3.5), brood size (2.8), and productivity of fledglings (2) per occupied territory have remained stable over the decades irrespective of the decline of the forest grouse. Proportion of grouse in the diet as well as breeding output closely followed the density of grouse during the 1950s-1970s with relatively dense grouse populations but this close connection has recently disappeared, probably due to a decline of grouse and disappearance of their multi-annual cycles. Goshawks are the most important cause of mortality among forest grouse, and grouse density, in turn, affects the dispersal distances of juvenile goshawks. Because of the narrower diet width of males compared to that of females, males tend to move over longer distances than females. Among adults, females move more than males, like in other raptors. Median distances moved by juveniles range from 50-100 km but some individuals can travel up to > 1,000 km. After the dispersal phase, juveniles tend to establish more or less stable ranges before moving to the final breeding range. Not much is known about the site tenacity of breeders but in good conditions males, at least, likely remain on their territories throughout their life. Winter range size varies from 2,000-10,000 ha depending on sex, age, and the quality of the habitat or of the prey size. Juvenile males suffer from higher mortality than juvenile females but this difference disappears by the third year of life. Based on field studies and museum data, roughly one-third of fuvenile hawks succumb because of starvation, one-third of trauma or trauma and starvation-disease, and one-fifth to one-third are killed by hunters. Productivity of goshawk populations has not changed during the years of declining trends found in many local studies, which may indicate an increased adult mortality. Annual mortality among the adults may likely not exceed 30% without a decline of the breeding population. The ultimate reason behind declining goshawk populations is likely the change in the forest bird community due to intensified forestry which has negatively affected the populations of main prey, forest grouse. Problems in nourishment of goshawks occur during the winter after migratory birds have moved to south.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This review concerns the environmental regulation of seasonal reproduction in birds and how this process might differ between males and females. From an evolutionary perspective, the sexes can be expected to differ in the cues they use to time reproduction. Female reproductive fitness typically varies more as a function of fecundity selection, while male reproductive fitness varies more as a function sexual selection. Consequently, variation in the precision of the timing of egg laying is likely to have more serious fitness consequences for females than for males, while variation in the timing of recrudescence of the male testes and accompanying territory establishment and courtship are likely to have more serious fitness consequences for males. From the proximate perspective, sex differences in the control of reproduction could be regulated via the response to photoperiod or in the relative importance and action of supplementary factors (such as temperature, food supply, nesting sites and behavioural interactions) that adjust the timing of reproduction so that it is in step with local conditions. For example, there is clear evidence in several temperate zone avian species that females require both supplementary factors and long photoperiods in order for follicles to develop, while males can attain full gonadal size based on photoperiodic stimulation alone. The neuroendocrine basis of these sex differences is not well understood, though there are many candidate mechanisms in the brain as well as throughout the entire hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis that might be important.",10.1098/rstb.2007.2137,,JRY,No,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, we investigated the diet and breeding biology of buzzards as well as abundance of their possible prey during 5 years in the low-Arctic shrub tundra on the Nenetsky Ridge, Russia. We employed three complementary methods to assess the diet of this Arctic predator-pellet dissection, identification of prey remains on nests, and stable isotope analysis-to overcome their respective limitations. We documented fluctuations in abundances of the likely prey, namely rodents, ptarmigans, and hares. Nesting density of buzzards changed substantially over the years, but did not track the abundance cycle of the rodents. The number of buzzard fledglings was relatively low (1.08 +/- A 0.3) and did not change according to the density of rodents. In the year when rodents were at their lowest abundance, diet analyses of nestlings documented a shift from rodents to alternative prey, with a decrease in the proportion of tundra voles and an increase in proportion of hares, ptarmigans, and ducks. Here, we argue that buzzards may adopt different feeding strategies along the gradient from generalists to specialists. While the rough-legged buzzard is usually considered a small rodent specialist, our study shows that it can shift to alternative prey where or when rodents are scarce and when alternative prey are sufficiently abundant to provide subsistence for breeding.",10.1007/s00300-013-1441-2,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In each line, three groups were created; one group in which the chicks were fed ad lib. and two other groups in which the chicks received 70% and 40% of the line-specific ad lib. feeding levels, respectively. In all three groups, chick survival rates were very high, and no relationship was detected between feeding level and chick mortality. The experimental feeding levels strongly affected the chicks' attainment of body mass at all ages. In addition, at most ages the growth of the structural components (wing, tarsus, and head) were also significantly affected by the feeding experiment but to a much smaller extent than the body mass. The feeding levels also affected the achievement of female sexual maturity such that, at the end of the experiment, most of the ad lib.-fed females and none of the females that received 40% of the ad lib. feeding level were laying eggs. In chicks of both lines that were fed ad lib., homeothermy was achieved at 7 d of age, but in chicks that received 40% of the line-specific ad lib. levels, homeothermy was achieved after 15-22 d of age. Poikilothermic chicks (P- and C-line) that were relatively heavy for their age exhibited relatively high resting metabolic rates (RMRs) and peak metabolic rates (PMRs) for their age. In addition, a positive relationship was found between the chicks' relative mass and RMR (based on mass-based predictive equations). No relationship was detected between the chicks' relative body mass and their relative PMR (relative to mass-based predictive equations). With respect to the metabolic scope (i.e., PMR - RMR), Japanese quail chicks exhibited remarkable developmental plasticity: chicks with body masses that were 50% lower than the normal growing chicks did exhibit a normal capacity of thermogenic heat production for their mass. Because no differences were found with respect to the level of plasticity of morphological and physiological development between the two strains, we conclude that the selection for high postnatal growth rates in P-strain chicks has not resulted in a in a higher vulnerability of these chicks to food restrictions.",10.1086/319314,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,Food pellets; not insects,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We simulated the abrupt change in the diet which takes place when hand-reared birds are released into the wild. In the test group body mass decreased significantly after the change in diet. However, within one week body mass started to increase again, but it stabilised at a lower level than in control birds. Birds in the test group consumed more food (fresh weight) during the feeding trial and even produced more excreta during the second, fourth and fifth week of the feeding trial. Gross energy intake, amount of metabolised energy and metabolised energy coefficient decreased and excretory energy content increased during the feeding trial.

Management objectives for fine-scale vegetation characteristics (e.g., grass height >18 cm) have been adopted by land management agencies based on resource selection or relationships with fitness proxies reported among numerous habitat studies. Some managers, however, have questioned the appropriateness of these objectives. Moreover, it remains untested whether habitat-fitness relationships documented at fine scales (i.e., among individual nests within a study area) also apply at scales of management units (e.g., pastures or grazing allotments), which are many orders of magnitude larger. We employed meta-analyses of studies published from 1991 to 2019 to help resolve the role of fine-scale vegetation structure in nest site selection and nest success across the geographic range of greater sage-grouse (C. urophasianus) and evaluate the validity of established habitat management objectives. Specifically, we incorporated effects of study design and functional responses to resource availability in meta-regression models linking vegetation structure to nest site selection, and used a novel meta-analytic approach to simultaneously model vegetation structure and its relationship to nest success. Our approach tested habitat relationships at a range-wide extent and a grain size closely matching scales at which agencies make management decisions. We found moderate, but context-dependent, effects of shrub characteristics and weak effects of herbaceous vegetation on nest site selection. None of the tested vegetation characteristics were related to variation in nest success, suggesting nesting habitat-fitness relationships have been inappropriately extrapolated in developing range-wide habitat management objectives. Our findings reveal surprising flexibility in habitat use for a species often depicted as having very particular fine-scale habitat requirements, and cast doubt on the practice of adopting precise management objectives for vegetation structure based on findings of individual small-scale field studies.

Terrestrial predators in coastal areas are often subsidized by marine foods. In order to determine the potential impact on terrestrial prey, the numerical response of predators to each food source must be determined. 2. In winter, arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus) may forage on the frozen Arctic ocean and scavenge carcasses of seals killed by polar bears (Ursus maritimus), but the importance of this food source and its effect on the population cycles of arctic foxes and lemmings (their primary prey) are unclear. 3. I estimated the marine component of the late winter diet of arctic foxes near Churchill, Manitoba, using stable-carbon isotope analysis, and compared these estimates to abundance of arctic foxes and collared lemmings (Dicrostonyx richardsoni). 4. From 1994 to 1997, fox density varied with lemming abundance, but following a decline, fox abundance began increasing before lemmings. During this increase marine foods were consumed more than in other years, with over two-thirds of food intake from marine sources. 5. Arctic and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) harvests in the 1980s to 1990s were correlated with published estimates of polar bear body mass, which varies with seal productivity. However, this relationship disappeared during high lemming years. 6. Thus, variation in marine productivity affects arctic fox abundance, especially when their primary prey are scarce, and this numerical response of arctic foxes to marine resources and lemmings suggests that increased predation by arctic foxes subsidized by seal carrion may delay the recovery of low lemming populations.",10.1046/j.1365-2656.2003.00739.x,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whatever the modelling of the reproductive performances and the range of adult survival rates considered, the risks of extinction were high. They were very sensitive to adult survival rates and variability in reproductive performances. Populations with the longest duration between two successful reproductions were at the greatest risks of extinction. The time elapsed between two successful reproductions may depend on failure to respond to rodent peaks. The cyclicity of food availability for arctic fox may have been the main selective force for their large litter size, but may also be the cause of a fine-tuned, and fragile dynamic system.",10.1016/S0006-3207(00)00134-8,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate whether the presence of a prey species affects the population growth rate of another prey species, we quantified predator-mediated interaction strength using a multi-prey mechanistic model of predation and a population matrix model. Models were parametrized using behavioural, demographic and experimental data from a vertebrate community that includes the arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), a predator feeding on lemmings and eggs of various species such as sandpipers and geese. We show that the positive effects of the goose colony on sandpiper nesting success (due to reduction of search time for sandpiper nests) were outweighed by the negative effect of an increase in fox density. The fox numerical response was driven by changes in home range size. As a result, the net interaction from the presence of geese was negative and could lead to local exclusion of sandpipers. Our study provides a rare empirically based model that integrates mechanistic multi-species functional responses and behavioural processes underlying the predator numerical response.

To examine spatial and temporal variation in productivity, we estimated breeding parameters at 5 sites in Alaska: at Cape Espenberg and the Copper River Delta we estimated nest survival, and at 3 sites within the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta we estimated nest survival and productivity. Nest survival varied broadly among sites and years; annual estimates (lower, upper 95% confidence interval) ranged from 0.09 (0.03, 0.29) at Cape Espenberg in 2001 to 0.93 (0.76, 0.99) at the Copper River Delta in 2002. Annual variation among sites was not concordant, suggesting that site-scale factors had a strong influence on nest survival. Models of nest survival indicated that visits to monitor nests had a negative effect on nest daily survival probability, which if not accounted for biased nest survival strongly downward. The sensitivity of breeding Red-throated Loons to nest monitoring suggests other sources of disturbance that cause incubating birds to flush from their nests may also reduce nest survival. Nest daily survival probability at the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta was negatively associated with an annual index of fox occurrence. Survival through the incubation and chick-rearing periods on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta ranged from 0.09 (0.001, 0.493) to 0.50 (0.04, 0.77). Daily survival probability during the chick-rearing period was lower for chicks that had a sibling in 2 of 3 years, consistent with the hypothesis that food availability was limited. Estimates of annual productivity on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta ranged from 0.17 to 1.0 chicks per pair. Productivity was not sufficient to maintain population stability in 2 of 3 years, indicating that nest depredation by foxes and poor foraging conditions during chick rearing can have important effects on productivity.

However, the breeding success of hand-reared hen pheasants in the spring following their release has been shown to be very poor compared with that of wild hen pheasants. Possible explanations for this are an inability among hand-reared birds to identify natural food items or a shortage of appropriate foods. American literature indicates that, when available, cereal grains comprise an important component of pheasant diet. In this study, monocotyledon leaves constituted, on average, 87% of fragments in faeces collected from hand-reared pheasants in an area of intensive agriculture near Salisbury, Wiltshire, UK, during April-June 1994-1995. In experimental plots where wheat, Triticum aestivum, grains were supplied via hoppers along woodland edges, the mean proportion of monocotyledon fragments declined to 45% and wheat grain husk constituted 45% of all fragments, whereas these proportions were 87% and 0.5% respectively in plots where no supplementary wheat food was provided. Observations at dawn revealed that hen pheasants given supplementary wheat spent less time foraging for food and remained closer to field edges than hens in control areas. The sizes (3-5 ha) of the diurnal 95% harmonic mean home ranges of groups of radiotagged hen pheasants in the experimental and control areas (n=24 per area) were not different. The provision of wheat grains, with their high metabolizable energy, appears to enable hen pheasants to obtain their daily nutrient requirements more quickly than birds with an unsupplemented diet.",NA,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 190 the study area was enlarged to 425 km-2. During 15 years, the population density fluctuated between 3.6 and 7.4 breeding pairs (bp) per 100 km-2, with a median of 5.5 bp/100 km-2. The annual mean rate of reproduction varied between 0.5 and 1.8 fledged juveniles per breeding pair and was thus lower than mean values of other studies. There was a significant negative correlation between breeding density and rate of reproduction, which indicates density-dependent population regulation. Systematic surveys of prey remains revealed a strong preponderance of Woodpigeons Columba palumbus as prey. The ten most important prey species contributed over 80% (of the number of individuals) to the diet. Goshawk predation did not pose a significant threat to any of the prey species' populations. There were differences in diet composition between breeding and non-breeding season. During the breeding period, small birds played a more important role (7.4% compared to 4.3%) and the Domestic Pigeon Columba livia was also taken more frequently because of its higher availability in summer. The presence of other birds of prey and owls in the diet (Buteo buteo, Falco tinnunculus, Asio otus, Strix aluco) illustrates the dominant role of Goshawks as predators in the cultivated landscape. Unexpectedly, there was a negative correlation between rate of reproduction and average prey mass per territory. This might indicate the particular importance of small prey items early in the nesting period and/or the low profitability of large prey items (pheasant, hare) during the nestling period, because there are often lost to other predators. On the other hand, the proportions of both pigeon species in the diet correlated positively with rate of reproduction. In this area pigeons constitute the Goshawks' staple diet without which a high breeding success cannot be attained.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Habitat heterogeneity and predator behaviour can strongly affect predator[long dash]prey interactions but these factors are rarely considered simultaneously, especially when systems encompass multiple predators and prey. 2. In the Arctic, greater snow geese Anser caerulescens atlanticus L. nest in two structurally different habitats: wetlands that form intricate networks of water channels, and mesic tundra where such obstacles are absent. In this heterogeneous environment, goose eggs are exposed to two types of predators: the arctic fox Vulpes lagopus L. and a diversity of avian predators. We hypothesized that, contrary to birds, the hunting ability of foxes would be impaired by the structurally complex wetland habitat, resulting in a lower predation risk for goose eggs. 3. In addition, lemmings, the main prey of foxes, show strong population cycles. We thus further examined how their fluctuations influenced the interaction between habitat heterogeneity and fox predation on goose eggs. 4. An experimental approach with artificial nests suggested that foxes were faster than avian predators to find unattended goose nests in mesic tundra whereas the reverse was true in wetlands. Foxes spent 3[center dot]5 times more time between consecutive attacks on real goose nests in wetlands than in mesic tundra. Their attacks on goose nests were also half as successful in wetlands than in mesic tundra whereas no difference was found for avian predators. 5. Nesting success in wetlands (65%) was higher than in mesic tundra (56%) but the difference between habitats increased during lemming crashes (15%) compared to other phases of the cycle (5%). Nests located at the edge of wetland patches were also less successful than central ones, suggesting a gradient in accessibility of goose nests in wetlands for foxes. 6. Our study shows that the structural complexity of wetlands decreases predation risk from foxes but not avian predators in arctic-nesting birds. Our results also demonstrate that cyclic lemming populations indirectly alter the spatial distribution of productive nests due to a complex interaction between habitat structure, prey-switching and foraging success of foxes.",10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01354.x,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the positive effects of prenatal androgens are likely to be balanced by negative impacts on other fitness related traits, such as immune defence, especially when animals are subjected to unfavourable environmental conditions (e.g. a food shortage). To examine these relationships, we investigated the effects of genetic selection on high (HET) and low (LET) egg testosterone content in Japanese quail on the immune system under mild food restriction. To test immune response, we examined: (1) skin swelling after subcutaneous phytohaemagglutinine injection; and (2) acute phase response in reaction to intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration. Food restriction decreased body mass in comparison with ad libitum fed animals, but food restriction did not diminish the positive influence of increased maternal testosterone (mT) on body growth. Furthermore, three hours after LPS injection, plasma corticosterone levels and heterophil/lymphocyte ratio were not affected by increased mT. In fact, cell mediated immunity was enhanced in the HET as compared to the LET line. Thus, our data indicate no trade-off between growth rate and immune response in young quail hatched from eggs with high mT, even under conditions of mild food deficiency.",10.3184/175815514X13903006158502,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Partitioning of time, space, and food generally related to body size; small-bodied species (peregrines and rough-legged hawks) nested later, had shorter reproductive periods, used smaller cliffs with less overhang, and took smaller prey than large-bodies species. The raven, a passerine, was often the exception. The onset of laying for each raptor was closely related to arrival or emergence of major prey species. Gyrfalcons and ravens selected well-protected sites, while other species selected sites with southerly aspects that but little overhang protection. Overlap in prey use was high between eagles and gyrfalcons early in the breeding season. The spacing of all species except the rough-legged hawk tended to be regular, apparently as a result of intraspecific rather than interspecific factors. However, all species tended to nest far from occupied eagle sites. Reproductive success was not affected by distance to nearest intra- or inter-specific neighbor, except among gyrfalcons whose reproductive success was significantly lower when conspecifics nested within 5 km than when they nested farther away.

However, maintaining high GC levels are energetically costly and interfere with other physiological processes. To keep the balance of costs and benefits of GC hormones, various mechanisms act to adapt GC levels to environmental conditions on different timescales, i.e. over generations, between parents and their offspring and within the life-time of a single individual. We elucidated whether two strains (domesticated and wild) of grey partridges (Perdix perdix) differed in the developmental trajectories of baseline and stress response CORT throughout the first 80 days of life. We also explored the potential of prenatal and postnatal factors, e.g. parental origin, predictable vs. unpredictable food treatments, individual and social factors to modify these trajectories. Baseline CORT was similar between strains and unaffected by perinatal food treatments. It was negatively related to body size and body condition. Conversely, the CORT stress response was not markedly affected by physiological condition. It was stronger in wild than in domesticated birds and it increased with age. Birds subjected to prenatal unpredictable food supply exhibited an accelerated development of the CORT stress response which could reflect an adaptive maternal effect. We conclude that the vital role of baseline CORT may allow little adaptive scope since changes can quickly become detrimental. In contrast, the CORT stress response may show considerable adaptive potential which might ultimately support homeostasis in a changing environment. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

One additional group was allowed to select how much to eat of aphids and grasshoppers (self-selection). 2. Over the run of the 5-day experiment the self-selecting chicks ate 7% wet weight of aphids and showed a higher growth rate than all groups on fixed diets. 3.

The effects of long-term fasting and exogenous melatonin treatment on these weight-regulatory hormones were also investigated. The leptin concentrations of the blue fox increased during the autumnal accumulation of fat and decreased during the wintertime and vernal weight loss periods. The leptin levels peaked 2-6 weeks before the maximum values were observed for the body mass indices, voluntary food intake, and body masses. The ghrelin concentrations fluctuated widely during the autumn but decreased in the winter in association with suppression of food intake. Exogenous melatonin advanced the seasonal changes in the food intake of the blue fox but did not affect the seasonal rhythms of leptin and ghrelin concentrations. The leptin concentrations did not respond to the 3-week fasting periods in a consistent way, but the ghrelin levels increased due to food deprivation. In addition to the amount of fat in the body the leptin secretion of the blue fox may be regulated also by other factors. The blue fox may also express seasonal changes in its leptin sensitivity. Our results reinforce the hypothesis that leptin does not function as an acute indicator of body adiposity in seasonal carnivores but rather as a long-term signal of nutritional status.

To be safe from land predators red-breasted goose colonies were restricted to i) islands on rivers, ii) cliffs with peregrine falcons Falco peregrinus, and iii) the close proximity of snowy owl Nyctea scandiaca and rough-legged buzzard Buteo lagopus nests. Among years nest site availability varied by flactuations in numbers of owls and buzzards in association with cycles in lemming abundance, but the total number of goose nests found in the study area did not vary. The distribution of geese, in combination with data on reproductive success, suggested a despotic mechanism: at cliffs, goose numbers were constant among years with an invariably high reproductive success, whereas large fluctuations in numbers on islands coincided with opposite trends in success. Apparently, geese nesting with owls or buzzards moved to the few islands present in the study area during years when these birds of prey were absent. Consequently, in such years the average density of geese on islands was more than twice as high as at cliff colonies (5.4 and 2.3 pairs per ha of foraging habitat, respectively). Colony size at cliffs may have been restricted by territorial behaviour of the geese, though there is evidence that, additionally, the host falcons also limited the number of nesting geese. Apparently rare in closely related species, we observed a negative density-dependent effect on reproductive success during the nest phase, and attribute this to limited food resources, reinforced by the high frequency of territorial interactions. This leads to the conclusion that, in addition to predation pressure, nesting density is an important agent in the link between lemming cycles and goose breeding success.",10.1034/j.1600-0706.2003.12244.x,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rates of ammonia excretion, primary amine defaecation, and growth in terms of protein-nitrogen were monitored throughout larval life. Data were used to calculate daily ration, the coefficient of nitrogen utilization (absorption efficiency), and gross and net growth efficiencies. The developmental pattern of nitrogen balance was similar for plaice and blenny larvae. These species showed increasing growth efficiency (k1: 55 of 80%) with decreasing weight-specific waste nitrogen losses with age. Absorption efficiencies were high (83 to 98%) in plaice and blenny larvae, and tended to increase with development in the former species. Ration relative to body weight decreased with growth in both species. Herring larval development, although at a slower rate than blenny and plaice, appeared normal up to 33 d, after which high mortality occurred. Absorption efficiency in this species tended to decline (83 to 43%) with age, until metabolic costs exceeded the absorbed ration and growth ceased. Artemia sp. nauplii proved a suitable food source for the rearing of plaice and blenny larvae, but this diet may have long-term toxicity or deficiency effects on herring. Availability and density of food affeced nitrogen balance in the larvae of all three species. Feeding stimulated the output of wastes in excretion and defaecation by a factor of up to ten times the 12-h non-feeding basal rates. Waste nitrogen output reached a peak some 2 to 3 h after commencement of feeding and returned slowly to the baseline in 5 to 10 h after cessation of feeding. There was an asymptotic increase in ration, ammonia output and growth of larvae as prey density increased. Ration saturation at a higher prey density (> 4 prey ml-1) than either growth or excretion rate (1 prey ml-1). Thus the efficiency with which food is absorbed and utilized for growth must eventually decline in response to high prey density. The idea that larval fish are adapted to maximize ingestion and growth rate, rather than optimize growth efficiency and thus to respond to prey occurring in either low density or in occasional patches, is supported by these results.",10.1007/BF00508256,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1132,NIEWOLD F J J and NIJLAND H,1987,THE OUTLOOK FOR THE WEST EUROPEAN MOORLAND AND HEATHLAND BLACKCOCK,Zeitschrift fuer Jagdwissenschaft,33,4,"The populations of the blackcock on the heathland and high moorland areas of continental Western Europe continue to decline. In the Netherlands in spring 1985, 67 grey hens were counted on 14 territories while the total population of the whole region is estimated to be 250 to 300 grey hens. In view of a number of similarities and differences from the type specimen Tetrao tetrix tetrix, this blackcock is perhaps to be considered as a nominate subspecies along with Tetrao tetrix britaponicus. The geographical range is currently limited to Scotland and the territories of some relict ppulations in England [UK], Belgium. The Netherlands and Denmark. The blackcock found in the Federal Republic has more characteristics of the nominate type. This is probably the result of a recolonisation mainly with birds from the North. With the use of radiotelemetry and faeces analysis, the interrelationship between the resources offered by the biotope, nutrition of the chicks and reproductive success in four different areas were studied. A limited availability of a suitable biotope for breeding, consisting of open, tall and varied heather, clearly restricted the reproductive results, whreeby chick mortality is presumed to be the most important factor. Considering more recent developments in the surrounding land of the remaining heathland areas which above all restrict the breeding biotopes, the future of the blackcock in the countries of continental Western Europe must be described as bleak. Apart from the continuing advances of land clearance, afforestation, drainage and peat cutting, which affect the heath itself, there should also be mentioned the negative factor that the surrounding agricultural land has become largely unsuitable for the blackcock as a result of intensive cultivation. The habitat on the heathland itself suffered the effects of recently introduced broad management measures, such as mowing and burning, which as a result of the recent introduction of sheep were often aimed at more frequent regeneration of the heather. In addition, there is the problem of the ecological development of the heathland as a result of the seed of pines and birches blowing in and the area under grass has increased greatly in recent times. As expected, the recently introduced mechanical turf removal in the Netherlands will once again reduce the area under grass to a considerable extent. Because of the crude character of these measures, to suitable biotope for blackcock breeding will come available immediately. Alongside the reduction and repression of several negative factors not directly damaging to the biotope, only conservation measures favouring small structures can result in a sufficiently large area of suitable biotope on the heathland. Turf removal on marrow strips of limited length (ca. 10 .times. 50 m) perhaps supplemented by mowing and burning of areas of the same size and combined with a well-thought-out tree felling policy promises the best chances for the blackcock as well as for other endangered game-animal species. Because of the acute isolation of possible remnant populations, recolonisation through release in the wild of birds bred in captivity is the only possibility of testing the habitat suitability of areas of land after the introduction of suitable conservation measures.",10.1007/BF02241447,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is especially evident in arctic migrants, which are restricted by a narrow window of opportunity when environmental conditions are favorable for breeding. This general time constraint is amplified in rough-legged buzzards (Buteo lagopus) who, as many other arctic predators, rely on rodent (lemming) cycles during the breeding season, a 3-5 year period of waxing and waning local food abundance. It remains unclear how arctic predators, especially migrants, can find nesting areas where rodents are numerous when their selection time is so limited. We hypothesized that rough-legged buzzards select nesting areas during the previous breeding season. We tracked 43 rough-legged buzzards using GPS telemetry and assessed their movements post-breeding prospecting behavior to test our hypothesis. Here we show that rough-legged buzzards search for a nesting location during the previous breeding season in a post-breeding period. In the following year, individuals return to and attempt to breed in the area they inspected the year before. Rough-legged buzzards, regardless of breeding success, remained in the Arctic all breeding season until the end of September. Failed breeders prospected more than successful ones. At the same time, buzzards that bred in the rodent-free ecosystem prospected less and showed a high level of philopatry. Therefore, as rodent cycles have been predicted to collapse in the warming Arctic, we can expect arctic predators to change their movement patterns in the future with serious potential consequences for their conservation. We anticipate our study provides a step forward toward understanding movement and settlement decisions in animals experiencing high inter-annual environmental variation.",10.3389/fevo.2022.865482,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Predator-prey interactions can have widespread ecological effects but there is a paucity of information about predator effects on sage-grouse ecology. During a two-year study from 2011-2012, we modified the existing framework designed for predator management to test the effects of coyote Canis latrans removal on female sage-grouse survival and nest success in the Bighorn Basin of Wyoming, USA, where coyotes were found to be the dominant predator. We used VHF radio-telemetry to monitor female survival and locate nests over pre-treatment and treatment breeding seasons, and for one-year post-treatment to the next breeding season. During treatment, we manipulated predator management at three sites to have targeted, non-targeted, and no coyote removal. Female survival remained constant over the nesting period when treatment was applied, and there were little differences between one-year pre-(S. = 0.64, 90% CI = 0.38, 0.90) and one-year post-treatment survival estimates ((S) over cap = 0.71, 90% CI = 0.55, 0.87) at the targeted coyote removal site. No differences were detected in the daily survival rates of nests relative to coyote removal. We conclude removing coyotes, the primary predator of nests and adult females identified within this system, did not improve female survival or nest success.

However, a growing body of research indicates that predators are not necessarily limited by such processes in the wild. Density-dependent changes in predator foraging behavior can also generate positive indirect effects but they are rarely included as explicit functions of prey densities in functional response models. With the aim of untangling proximate mechanisms of species interactions in natural communities and improving our ability to quantify interaction strength, we extended the multi-prey version of the Holling disk equation by including density-dependent changes in predator foraging behavior. Our model, based on species traits and behavior, was inspired by the vertebrate community of the arctic tundra, where the main predator (the arctic fox) is an active forager feeding primarily on cyclic small rodent (lemming) and eggs of various tundra-nesting bird species. Short-term positive indirect effects of lemmings on birds have been documented over the circumpolar Arctic but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We used a unique data set, containing high-frequency GPS tracking, accelerometer, behavioral, and experimental data to parameterize the multi-prey model, and a 15-year time series of prey densities and bird nesting success to evaluate interaction strength between species. We found that (1) prey handling processes play a minor role in our system and (2) changes in arctic fox daily activity budget and distance traveled can partly explain the predation release on birds observed during lemming peaks. These adjustments in predator foraging behavior with respect to the main prey density thus appear as the dominant mechanism leading to positive indirect effects commonly reported among arctic tundra prey. Density-dependent changes in functional response components have been little studied in natural vertebrate communities and deserve more attention to improve our ability to quantify the strength of species interactions.",10.1002/ecy.3734,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Identifying species susceptibility to warming is relevant in assessing risks to animal populations and ecological processes. The progressive increase in ambient temperature as a result of global warming might have an effect on the timing of primary moult. This could affect a bird's annual cycle, influencing reproductive success and population dynamics. We describe a method to examine the potential effects of global warming on the primary moult process in a sedentary population of Red-legged Partridges (Alectoris rufa). We organised the factors that might influence the timing of moult end into a network and distinguished between environmental and intrinsic factors. We sorted the factors according to their contribution to quantitative moult models and constructed a diagrammatic scheme showing their interactions and effect on the end of primary moult over the annual cycle. In Red-legged Partridges, the timing of the end of moult varies according to age-sex class. We found no timing differences by age, but found significant timing differences by adult sex. More females overlap their moult with juveniles than males because female parental effort is higher, more females incubate and brood chicks. The timing of the end of moult varies by year due to conspecific interactions that change according to influences of the weather, habitat, and social and flock conditions. Parent birds synchronize their primary moult with the chick's growth, degree of cover and food resources. From the time of hatching to the following year, the date (day-length), social factors (conspecific interactions), and weather (resources) affect the timing of moult and the birds' annual cycle. Global warming affects the timing of the end of moult and that of the annual cycle. If the extent of the breeding period is shortened, there could be a negative effect on population outcomes. Middle size prey species are key in trophic chains. Our results suggest that the timing of the end of moult could be used as a proxy measure of warming impacts on wildlife and ecosystems and also as a tool for the management of game birds.",10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.107287,,JME,Phasianidae,No,,No,climate change; moult study ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Average dietary breadth (0.46) was comparatively high but within the range reported for other North American studies.

One major reason for Grey Partridge population collapse in Europe is the decreased chick survival rate which directly reflects the abundance and biomass of invertebrates as essential chick food. We evaluated a new methodological design using human-imprinted Grey Partridge chicks as a biological assay to compare relative food availability (g / chick / 30 min) in five different habitat types in an arable landscape. On average, partridge chicks slightly lost weight during the trials in all considered arable habitat types, indicating a low invertebrate biomass but also indicating methodological limitations of our approach. The greatest weight loss was found in the conventional crops maize and wheat and on eutrophic grass tracks; the lowest in segetal vegetation patches within wheat fields and in wildflower crop cultivated as ecologically sound cosubstrate for biogas production. An increased defaecation rate due to the handling procedure is suggested to account for the weight loss so that invertebrate availability is discussed comparing the extent to which chicks could compensate this weight loss through food intake. Considering the discussed methodological restrictions in future studies, weight changes in human-imprinted Grey Partridge chicks provide a biologically relevant index of food availability and foraging value of farmland habitats and crops. Thus, these are suitable for evaluating and monitoring the quality of farmland habitats for the Grey Partridge.",NA,,JME,Phasianidae,Insect availability,No,No,Captive chick experiment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Experimental nests (n = 276) resembling black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) nests were proportionally installed along three types of roads discriminated by utility (road type, from frequently used to unused: tarred roads, gravel roads and forest paths) and inside/outside the red-deer enclosure. The nests were placed in couples, with one nest placed close to the road edge and the second placed inside the surrounding forest habitat to assess the ""travel line"" hypothesis. The ""travel line"" hypothesis was not supported because there was a similar predation rate among edge and interior nests. Even if predators can be discouraged along busy roads, type of road also did not affect nest predation.

Development of anti-predator behaviour may be impaired in captive conditions which favour low emotional reactivity, resulting in poor perception of danger. Therefore, the newly reintroduced, naive animals may not behave adaptively in terms of anti-predator vigilance, resulting in increased vulnerability to predators. Such behavioural deficiencies may have contributed to the low success rates of reintroductions, but few studies have measured post-release vigilance in captive-bred animals, and none has been published on reintroduced grey partridges. Therefore, in this study we investigated post-release vigilance behaviour and time budgets in coveys of captive-bred grey partridges (Perdix perdix: N = 26) released in autumn over two years. We observed the captive-bred grey partridge coveys in the field, and recorded their group vigilance rates as well as time budgets of individual behaviour, including vigilance and feeding. Released grey partridges had low group vigilance rates and showed poor individual vigilance (4-5% of time spent vigilant) compared to their wild counterparts (43% of time spent vigilant; Watson et al., 2007). Moreover, released individuals spent 30-48% of their time feeding, and fed at this rate throughout the day, instead of concentrating their feeding around dawn and dusk like wild grey partridges do. The revealed vigilance and feeding behaviour in released grey partridges are likely to increase vulnerability to predators, and therefore offer plausible explanations for the high predation rates of released grey partridges observed with these and previous releases. Rearing methods should be developed to encourage wariness in the captive animals. In addition, the adaptive bimodal feeding routine of wild grey partridges should be encouraged in the captive-bred birds, for example by feeding them only at dawn and dusk. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The abundances of generalist predators have been positively associated with the abundance of gamebirds. These relationships have implications for prey populations, with the potential for indirect impacts of gamebird releases on wider biodiversity. To understand the basis of these associations, we investigated variation in territory size, prey provisioning to chicks, and breeding success of common buzzards Buteo buteo, and associations with variation in the abundances of free-roaming gamebirds, primarily pheasants Phasianus colchicus, and of rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus and field voles Microtus agrestis, as important prey for buzzards. The relative abundance of gamebirds, but not those of rabbits or voles, was weakly but positively correlated with our index of buzzard territory size. Gamebirds were rarely brought to the nest. Rabbits and voles, and not gamebirds, were provisioned to chicks in proportion to their relative abundance. The number of buzzard chicks increased with provisioning rates of rabbits, in terms of both provisioning frequency and biomass, but not with provisioning rates for gamebirds or voles. Associations between the abundances of buzzards and gamebirds may not be a consequence of the greater availability of gamebirds as prey during the buzzard breeding season. Instead, the association may arise either from habitat or predator management leading to higher densities of alternative prey (in this instance, rabbits), or from greater availability of gamebirds as prey or carrion during the autumn and winter shooting season. The interactions between gamebird releases and associated practices of predator control and shooting itself require better understanding to more effectively intervene in any one aspect of this complex social-ecological system.",10.1002/ece3.8877,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scyphozoan jellyfish, their food and their rich symbiotic fauna in a tropical estuary",PeerJ,6,NA,"Background. The anthropogenic modification of trophic pathways is seemingly prompting the increase of jellyfish populations at the expense of planktivorous fishes. However, gross generalizations are often made because the most basic aspects of trophic ecology and the diverse interactions of jellyfish with fishes remain poorly described. Here we inquire on the dynamics of food consumption of the medusoid stage of the scyphozoan jellyfish Stomolophus meleagris and characterize the traits and diversity of its symbiotic community. Methods. S. meleagris and their associated fauna were sampled in surface waters between November 2015 and April 2017 in Malaga Bay, an estuarine system at the Colombian Pacific. Stomach contents of medusae were examined and changes in prey composition and abundance over time analysed using a multivariate approach. The associated fauna was identified and the relationship between the size of medusae and the size those organisms tested using least-square fitting procedures. Results. The presence of S. meleagris medusa in surface waters was seasonal. The gut contents analysis revealed that algae, copepods and fish early life stages were the more abundant items, and PERMANOVA analysis showed that the diet differed within the seasons (P(perm) = 0.001) but not between seasons (P(perm) = 0.134). The majority of the collected medusae (50.4%) were associated with individuals of 11 symbiotic species, 95.3% of them fishes, 3.1% crustaceans and 1.6% molluscs. Therefore, this study reports 10 previously unknown associations. The bell diameter of S. meleagris was positively related to the body sizes of their symbionts. However, a stronger fit was observed when the size relationship between S. meleagris and the fish Hemicaranx zelotes was modelled. Discussion. The occurrence of S. meleagris was highly seasonal, and the observed patterns of mean body size through the seasons suggested the arrival of adult medusae to the estuary from adjacent waters. The diet of S. meleagris in the study area showed differences with previous reports, chiefly because of the abundance of algae that are seemingly ingested but not digested. The low number of zooplanktonic items in gut contents suggest the contribution of alternative food sources not easily identifiable. The observed changes in the composition of food in the guts probably reflect seasonal changes in the availability of prey items. The regular pattern in the distribution of symbionts among medusae (a single symbiont per host) and the positive host-symbiont size relationship reflects antagonistic intraspecific and interspecific behaviour of the symbiont. This strongly suggest that medusa represent an ""economically defendable resource"" that potentially increases the survival and recruitment of the symbionts to the adult population. We argue that, if this outcome of the symbiotic association can be proven, scyphozoan jellyfish can be regarded as floating nurseries.",10.7717/peerj.5057,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This was the start of a long term study of population ecology of Scandinavian wolves. All pups, although belonging to 5 different packs, were of similar size and weighed between 35 and 39 kg. The adult females had a body weight of 35 and 42 kg while the adult males all weighed between 49 and 52 kg. The radio collared wolves were located on average 3-4 times per week using telemetry both from the ground and from fixed wing aircraft. Detailed information on movements and hunting behaviour was obtained through snow tracking when feasible. Prey remains and wolf scats found during these tracking events were collected and analyzed. Annual sizes for three territories were all close to 1000 km2. During summer intensive radio tracking day and night revealed no distinct activity pattern. Wolves were only slightly more active during early mornings and late evenings and moved on average 20-25 km per 24 hours. In March, at an age of 10 months, three of the four radio collared pups dispersed from their home territories, while the last radio collared pup dispersed in June. The young wolves dispersed in different directions and at varying straight line distances ranging from 13 km to more than 400 km. The true dispersal distances recorded were generally more than twice the straight line distance recorded. Two of the four dispersing wolves were still moving in beginning of December 1999. Scat analyses and snow tracking of radio collared alpha wolves showed that moose (Alces alces) was the main prey taken and may constitute >90% of the biomass consumed in winter and >85% in summer. Consumption of other prey species includes roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), black grouse (Tetrao tetrix) hares (Lepus timidus), beavers (Castor fiber) and small rodents. In one territory wolves killed moose with an interval of 5 days during winter and were successful in 71% of their hunting attempts on moose. Of the winter killed moose >80% were calves which indicates a strong preference for this age class.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

APH says that densities of predators increase as a response to increasing vole densities and then these predators shift their diet from the main prey to the alternative prey when the main prey decline and vice versa. We studied the diet composition of breeding common buzzards Buteo buteo during 1985-92 in western Finland. Microtus voles were the main prey and water voles, shrews, forest grouse, hares and small birds the most important alternative prey. Our data from the between-year variation in the diet composition of buzzards fulfilled the main predictions of APH. The yearly proportion of main prey (Microtus voles) in the diet was higher in years of high than low vole abundance. The proportion of grouse in the diet of buzzards was negatively related to the abundance of Microtus voles in the field and was nearly independent of grouse abundance in the field. In addition, buzzards mainly took grouse chicks and young hares which is consistent with the prediction of APH. Therefore, we conclude that buzzards are able to shift their diet in the way predicted by the APH and that buzzards, together with other generalist predators, may reduce the breeding success of small game in the decline phase of the vole cycle, and thus substantially contribute to the existence of short-term population cycles of small game.",10.1034/j.1600-0587.2001.240304.x,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Populations from northeast Asia must cope with extremely low temperatures along with progressive depletion of food resources throughout the winter. Being unable to roost in the snow at -40.degree. C, a ptarmigan's daily life would cost 3.2-3.5 basal metabolis rate (BM), but by burrowing in snow for up to 21 hours per day, the bird saves at least 1.0 BM. To meet daily energy demands on a midwinter day a ptarmigan needs about 60 g of food (dry weight), consisting mostly of willow buds and twigs. Early in winter the diet contains 12-15% protein and 20-25% fiber, declining later to 7-8% protein and increasing up to 35% fiber. Nitrogen concentration, crucial for food digestibility, declines by half (from 0.35 to 0.18%) during the six winter months. Nitrogen also causes increased food consumed in a feedback pattern. Nevertheless, many birds lose body weight constantly. To recover losses they need a more nutritious diet after the snow starts to melt. Thus, the willow ptarmigan's adaptation to the polar winter appears as an individual balancing act within a few specific limits. Higher density of conspecific birds, colder winters and/or later springs may cause physiological damage to individuals, which eventually would lower the reproduction rate within the breeding population.",NA,,JME,Phasianidae,No,,No,winter; plant abundance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spring food habits of 40 radio-tagged hens were documented by direct observation (21,262 min) during the period encompassing oviducal recrudescence, follicular development, and egg laying (late April-late May 1984-1986) and compared with clutch size and mean egg weight. Hens consumed conifer foliage, flowers, fruits, and foliage of ground plants, grit, and arthropods. Compared with their prebreeding diet, foods preferred in spring were rich in protein and P, but not necessarily Ca. Large clutch size was associated with a high rate of intake of the two most preferred foods, flowers of trailing arbutus (Epigaea repens) and spore capsules of Polytrichum mosses, and crude protein, P, and Ca, but was not related to the size of hens (body weight) or the size of endogenous reserves (sealed body weight). Egg size was not associated with spring diet or the size of endogenous reserves, but appeared to be related to the size of hens. Rate of intake of arbutus flowers and moss capsules was correlated with their availability on territories, suggesting that clutch size might have been proximately limited by food supply. However, rough estimates of nutrient intake suggested that the spring diet provided only about 60% of the protein and 45% of the Ca needed for clutch formation. Consequently, hens appeared to rely on both their spring diet and stored reserves for the nutrients required for clutch formation.",10.1139/z89-140,,JME,Phasianidae,No,,No,Plant abundance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During fasting intervals, body mass increased in pigeons, but decreased in quails.

In a long-term (2-week) fasting and refeeding experiment, the hepatic lepA and brain lepB showed a similar transcription change pattern induced by food deprivation stimulation but differential changes after refeeding.

However, despite the extensive use of birds as models for many research areas in biology, avian olfaction has been poorly investigated. Studies on bird species that lack well-developed olfactory organs and those investigating responses to predator odours are particularly scarce. We investigated behavioural responses of the domestic fowl, Gallus gallus domesticus, a ground-living species with intermediate olfactory bulb size, to several predator and nonpredator faecal odours. We found that the birds spent less time foraging and were more vigilant when exposed to predator faecal odour compared with nonpredator faecal odour. Individuals showed a similar response when exposed to increased amounts of faeces. Taken together, our results demonstrate that domestic fowl can distinguish between herbivore and predator faecal odour, and respond to predator olfactory cues alone, without prior experience. Our results have implications for the understanding of predator-prey interactions and responses to olfactory cues in general, and for chemical communication in avian species more specifically.

The rodent population cycles of northern latitudes can be seen as both predictable and unpredictable, depending on the scale in time and space. The arctic fox Alopex lagopus is an opportunistic carnivore, but paradoxically, it seems to function as a specialist on fluctuating rodent Arvicolinae populations in most inland areas. We have studied the dietary response of arctic foxes in Sweden during 5 years of varying abundance of Norwegian lemming Lemmus lemmus, and how these changes influenced the reproductive success of the foxes. The arctic fox population on mainland Fennoscandia is threatened by extinction and the situation has deteriorated during the 1980s and 1990s because of an absence of lemming peaks. Our results showed that in all years, lemming was the main prey for arctic foxes, with 85% frequency of occurrence in summer faeces (scats). Bird remains (mainly Passeriformes) were present in 34% of the scats, reindeer Rangifer tarandus in 21%, voles and shrews in 4% and hares Lepus timidus in 2% of the scats. The occurrences of lemming, bird and larger mammal (reindeer and hare) remains in the scats varied significantly between years. Temporal variations within summer seasons and dietary differences between sub-areas, indicated that arctic foxes fed opportunistically on the alternative prey types. Den occupancy rates were positively correlated with lemming population densities during the previous winter, indicating a strong numerical response. We conclude that from a functional aspect, the arctic fox in Sweden is a lemming specialist, since lemming is the main prey and their abundance is the best predictor of arctic fox reproductive success.

Raven populations are increasing at unprecedented rates in many regions globally. Information regarding scale of impact and potential ecological thresholds is needed to guide conservation actions aimed at reducing adverse effects on sensitive prey. We conducted a multipart analysis to investigate broad-scale variation in raven densities and impacts on nesting greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), an indicator species for sagebrush ecosystems in western North America. We estimated raven densities using > 16,000 point surveys over 10 years within the Great Basin, USA, and examined associations with anthropogenic and environmental covariates. Average density was 0.54 ravens km-2 (95% CI: 0.42-0.70), with higher densities at lower relative elevations comprising increased agriculture and development. We then used a reduced dataset to estimate the effect of raven density on sage-grouse nest survival (nests = 737). We identified negative impacts to nesting sage-grouse, especially where raven density exceeded [approximately]0.40 km-2, a potential ecological threshold. We mapped regions where elevated raven densities were predicted to depress sage-grouse population growth in the absence of compensatory demographic responses from other sage-grouse life-history stages, and found [approximately]64% of sage-grouse breeding areas were adversely impacted by high raven density.",10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108409,,JME,Phasianidae,No,,No,predation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this non-native environment, the species has flourished and has become the dominant apex predator on many reefs. In the present study, a comparison of non-native populations of C. argus in the MHI with native populations in Moorea showed that mean total length (32.0 vs. 26.9 cm), mass (722 vs. 326 g), growth, and body condition were each significantly elevated in the MHI. In addition, while an ontogenetic shift towards larger prey occurred in both locations, it was faster and more consistent in Moorea than in the MHI. As a result, while small C. argus of comparable size in the 2 locations consumed similar-sized prey, large C. argus in Moorea consumed significantly longer and deeper-bodied prey than their counterparts in the MHI. This pattern was unrelated to the size distributions of available prey and may thus reflect stronger intra-and interspecific competition for small prey in Moorea. Although ecological release in a broader sense (i.e. a combination of predator release, parasite release, and competitive release) may play a role, the most direct explanation for the observed differences between C. argus in native habitats in Moorea (with many competing grouper species) and non-native habitats in the MHI (few competitors) would be competitive release (here used in the sense of benefits resulting from the reduction of interspecific competition).",10.3354/meps09338,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jackson Hole and the upper Green River valley in western Wyoming are experiencing accelerated rates of human development due to tourism and natural gas development, respectively. Increased raven populations in these areas may negatively influence the Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), a sensitive sagebrush specialist. We investigated landscape-level patterns in raven behavior and distribution and the correlation of the raven data with the grouse's reproductive success in western Wyoming. In our study areas towns provide ravens with supplemental food, water, and nest sites, leading to locally increased density but with apparently limited (< 3 km) movement by ravens from towns to adjacent areas of undeveloped sagebrush. Raven density and occupancy were greatest in land covers with frequent human activity. In sagebrush with little human activity, raven density near incubating and brooding sage-grouse was elevated slightly relative to that expected and observed in sagebrush not known to hold grouse. Raven occupancy near sage-grouse nests and broods was more highly correlated with sage-grouse success than were raven density and behavior, suggesting that the majority of nest predation by ravens is most likely carried out by resident territorial individuals. Integrated region-wide improvement of sagebrush habitat, removal of anthropogenic subsidies, and perhaps removal or aversive conditioning of offending ravens might benefit sage-grouse populations in our study area.",10.1525/cond.2010.090132,,JME,Phasianidae,No,,No,predation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here, demographic and other causes of a population cycle were documented from 1979-1989, and an experiment tested the prediction that removing some cocks during the increase phase would prevent subsequent cyclic decline. Throughout the study, sport shooting was stopped on the area where the main work was done. During 1979-1982, before the experimental removal of cocks began, numbers over the whole moor rose from a trough at the start of the study. On the control area, the cyclic peak in 1983 was followed by a decline until 1988, as predicted in advance from models derived from a previous study elsewhere. On the experimental area, enough territorial cocks were removed each spring from 1982 to 1986 to prevent the population from attaining peak densities for five successive years, and no cyclic decline occurred. The removal of cocks resulted in similar numbers of hens being lost from the breeding population. The main demographic cause of population change on control (cycling) and experimental (cycle broken) areas was variation in the recruitment of young cocks to the spring population. On the control area, recruitment was related to cycle phase and breeding success. Changes in food, nitrogen metabolism, and parasite burdens could not explain the cycle. Demographic patterns were consistent with a model in which changes in age structure affected recruitment. These and previous results refute four hypotheses as necessary causes of population cycles in Red Grouse: (1) maternal nutrition, (2) a version of Chitty's genetic hypothesis, (3) host-parasite (caecal threadworm), and (4) predator-prey relationships.

Work in birds indicates that females do, indeed, bias sex ratios according to maternal condition and food quality and quantity. Yet it is unknown whether these sex ratio skews occur due to fluctuations in particular micro- or macro-nutrients, caloric content overall or even the perception of food availability. We hypothesized that dietary fats may drive biases in offspring sex ratios, because measures of maternal condition often reflect fat reserves, and fats are critical for the process of egg-laying in birds. To test this, we provided breeding Japanese quail, a species that biases sex ratios in response to maternal condition, with either a control breeding diet or a diet supplemented with two oils (safflower oil and flaxseed oil). These oils were chosen for their high omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid content as well as their importance in mammalian sex allocation. We then measured influences of these diets on the sex ratio of offspring, the change in maternal weight, and the laying rates of female quail. The dietary oil supplements increased weight gains in quail but decreased the number of eggs laid during the experiment. There was no influence of the oil supplements on offspring sex ratios.

Bird species whose prey base consists of larger fish were found to have approximately four times the hepatic concentration of mercury as did those species which consume smaller fish or crustaceans.

Grey partridge is a farmland species which has experienced a significant decline across Europe in recent decades. Chick survival rate is a key determinant of grey partridge population change and depends essentially on the availability of insect food. In this study, ground-dwelling and canopy-dwelling insects were collected using pitfall trapping and sweep netting methodologies, respectively, on different strip types in an area established for the conservation of grey partridge. The aim was to further our understanding of the value of different vegetated strip types in providing insect-rich habitats for grey partridge chicks. Overall, wildflower strip (WS) provided the greatest insect abundance. Significantly more ground-dwelling insects were found on WS, natural regeneration (NS) and leguminous strips (LS) than on grass strip (GS). Canopy-dwelling insects were also significantly more abundant on WS compared to all other strip types. This study highlights that WSs may represent important habitats in providing insect-rich food for grey partridge chicks and sowing these strips may therefore play a key role in decreasing chick mortality and supporting grey partridge conservation. It also demonstrates that other different vegetated strip types may still provide strip-specific insect taxa, in addition to other valuable resources. This study recommends a complex mosaic of different strip types to provide key resources for grey partridge, such as insect and plant food, nesting habitats and overwinter cover.",10.15212/ijafr-2020-0139,,JRY,Phasianidae,Insect availability,No,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Despite this, experiments that test the impact of ticks and tick-borne diseases on wild animal populations are rare. Here, we report on an experiment assessing the effect of ticks on red grouse productivity and chick growth in relation to other causes of poor recruitment at two sites in the Scottish uplands during 2005. Treated hens received two leg bands impregnated with the acaricide permethrin, while controls hens were untreated. Chicks were captured at c.2 weeks of age and fitted with a metal patagial tag, and chicks from treated hens also received a permethrin-impregnated strip. Mean tick burdens in treated chicks were close to zero compared with a mean of around 12 in the control group. Although treatment reduced tick infestations, it did not increase brood size. Growth rates in chicks from control and treated hens were similar during the first 10 days and comparable with chicks fed an ad-lib invertebrate-based diet. These results suggest that in this case, neither ticks (and the tick transmitted louping-ill virus) nor food shortages was the main cause of chick mortality. However, mortality in the adult hens was around 35 %, and predation accounted for 62 % of these losses before broods fledged. Our results indicate that on our study sites, predation may have a more important impact on grouse population dynamics than ticks and tick-borne disease. We suggest that it may be more cost effective to determine the causes of poor grouse population performance before implementing popular but expensive tick control measures such as the culling of alternative hosts and running acaracide treated sheep 'tick-mop' flocks.",10.1007/s10344-013-0788-6,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The increasing frequency of predation on colonial nesting seabirds and their eggs by the polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a consequence of bears shifting to terrestrial food resources through a shortened seal-hunting season. We examined antipredator responses in a colony of nesting Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima) on East Bay Island, Nunavut, Canada, which is exposed to established nest predators, such as arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), but also to recent increases in polar bear nest predation due to the bears' lost on-ice hunting opportunities. Given eiders' limited eco-evolutionary experience with bears, we aimed to experimentally contrast eider responses to the recent predation pressure by polar bears to those induced by their more traditional mammalian predator, the arctic fox. Our goal was to characterize whether this population of eiders was vulnerable to a changing predator regime. Using simulated approaches of visual stimuli of both predator types, we measured eider heart rate and flight initiation distance as physiological and behavioral metrics, respectively, to characterize the perceived risk of and subsequent response to imminent threat posed by these two predators that differ in historical encounter rates. Eider heart rates were more responsive to impending visual cues of arctic foxes compared to polar bears, but birds responded behaviorally to all simulated threats with similar flight initiation distances. Results suggest eiders may not perceive the full risk that bears pose as egg and adult predators, and are therefore expected to suffer negative fitness consequences from this ongoing and increasing interaction. Eiders may therefore require conservation intervention to aid in their management.",10.5751/ACE-02445-180122,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that experimentally food-restricted females with low antioxidant capacity would deposit more protoporphyrin and less biliverdin in their eggshells, resulting in eggshells of reduced brightness but increased colour intensity. Two eggs were collected at the beginning and two at the end of a 2 week period from each of 24 female Japanese quails that were either food restricted or receiving ad libitum food (i.e. controls) during that time. Reflectance spectra were recorded and analysed using spectral shape descriptors, chromatic and achromatic contrasts were computed accounting for avian visual sensitivities, and eggshell pigments were quantified. We examined both spot and background pigmentation and found no significant effect of food restriction on eggshell reflectance. However, food-restricted females in lower body condition increased the deposition of protoporphyrin and decreased the amount of biliverdin invested in their eggshells. We hypothesize that in species laying brown-spotted eggshells, females modulate eggshell pigment investment in response to their body condition. According to this hypothesis, we predict that females maintain eggshell colour to limit visible changes that could be detected by predators and thereby conceal their eggs, although this work has yet to be conducted. We suggest that further experimental work on egg camouflage under different environmental conditions will elaborate on the process of pigment deposition and the physiological costs to females of laying heavily pigmented eggshells.",10.1242/jeb.077370,,JRY,Phasianidae,Insect availability,No,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Data on the age and sex structure of the standing population were also collected. No differences in the age or sex structure of roe deer killed by lynx were found between the two study areas or between years with differing snow depths which was expected to affect age-class vulnerability. The profile of 151 lynx-killed roe deer (24% adult males, 44% adult females, 11% male fawns and 21% female fawns) was not statistically different from that of the standing population. In contrast, hunters killed a significantly larger proportion of adult animals, especially males (44% adult males, 28% adult females, 15% male fawns and 13% female fawns). The detailed age structure of lynx killed and hunter killed animals was not different within the adult age class. The body condition of roe deer declined during late winter (more so for males than for females), however, there was no difference in the condition of roe deer killed by lynx or hunters during early winter (the hunting season ends on 24 December). The overall picture is typical of a stalking predator that has few options to select individuals based on condition, age or sex in a prey species with no sexual dimorphism and which is relatively small in relation to the size of the predator (lynx are 50-70% the size of an adult roe deer). Human hunters, on the other hand, are clearly harvesting a non-random section of the population. The result is that hunting does not replicate natural predation, although lynx predation is likely to have a higher per capita impact on roe deer growth rates.",10.2981/0909-6396(2007)13[467:SOELLL]2.0.CO;2,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, some predator-prey relationships may still remain undetected, due to the difficulty of observing rare predation events. We report the first observation of predation of arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) pups by common ravens (Corvus corax). The predation event was witnessed on Bylot Island, Nunavut, Canada, through an automatic camera placed on a den. On June 8, 2013, the day following pup emergence from the den, the complete litter of four was killed and taken away by a pair of ravens despite the intermittent presence of the mother. This event lasted 2.5 h, occurred during a low lemming year, and resulted in the fox pair failing their reproduction. Only two other fox litters were present that summer in our 600 km(2) study area, so this litter predated by ravens accounted for 25 % (4/16) of the pups produced. Our report shows how continuous monitoring of dens using automatic cameras can allow documentation of rare events. In addition to food competition and cache raiding, pup predation contributes to the antagonistic interactions between arctic foxes and ravens in the High Arctic, which may intensify during low lemming years. This observation allows a better understanding of species interactions within the Arctic predator guild.",10.1007/s00300-015-1843-4,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fluctuations in the abundance of Antarctic krill are believed to have a substantial influence on the reproductive performance of krill-dependent top predator species in the Southern Ocean; few quantifications of such interactions exist. At South Georgia, for 2 years in which acoustic surveys revealed a major difference in krill abundance, we compared diet, provisioning of offspring and breeding success in 4 main predator species (2 penguins, 2 albatrosses, with supporting data from Antarctic fur seal) whose dependence on krill typically ranges from 20 to 90%. The 4-fold difference in krill biomass between 1986 (Ca 30 g m-2) and 1994 (Ca 7 g m-2) was accompanied by (1) an 88 to 90% reduction in the mass of krill in predator diets (and some increase in the fish component), (2) greater prey diversity for most species, (3) reduced diet overlap between species and (4) a switch from krill to amphipods in macaroni penguin but no major dietary change in other species. Rates of provisioning of offspring decreased by 90% in gentoo penguin and 40 to 50% in the other 3 species; this was due to reduced meal size in penguins (by 90% in gentoo and 50% in macaroni) and to doubling of foraging trip duration in albatrosses. Breeding success was reduced by 50% in grey-headed albatross (the species least dependent on krill), by 90% in black-browed albatross and gentoo penguin (only 3 to 4% of eggs producing fledged chicks) but by only 10% in macaroni penguin, presumably reflecting its ability to switch to small prey unprofitable for the other species. However, all species (except for black-browed albatross), particularly macaroni penguin, produced fledglings significantly lighter than usual, probably affecting their subsequent survival. Some effects on adult survival could also be inferred. Our results show a coherent, though complex, pattern of within and between species similarities and differences. These mainly reflect the degree of dependence on krill, the feasibility of taking alternative prey and constraints on trip duration and/or meal size imposed by foraging adaptations (especially relating to travel speeds and diving abilities, whereby flightless divers and pelagic foragers differ markedly). The generality of these principles are explored through comparison with other studies, particularly of Shetland seabirds.",10.3354/meps177115,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eggshell maculation (spots) is predominantly due to protoporphyrin, but both biliverdin (antioxidant) and protoporphyrin (pro-oxidant) may be present in spotted eggshells. Because of their role in oxidative stress, the deposition of eggshell pigments might be condition-dependent. However, because of the fitness benefits of eggshell coloration, cryptic eggshell appearance should be strongly conserved in ground-nesting species regardless of female condition and eggshell pigment concentrations. We investigated whether Japanese quails (Coturnix coturnix japonica) maintained eggshell maculation under food restriction. We quantified eggshell maculation (i.e., percentage of spot coverage) using digital photography, and both protoporphyrin and biliverdin concentrations of eggs laid by females either on a food-restricted or an ad libitum diet. Females on a high quality diet, which are known to decrease the deposition of eggshell protoporphyrin, decreased eggshell maculation compared with food-restricted females that maintained it. For the first time, we propose an experimental study which suggests that eggshell maculation depends on female body condition and that manipulating eggshell maculation may be the strategy used by females to potentially optimize egg camouflage.",10.1007/s10336-015-1278-2,,JRY,Phasianidae,Insect availability,No,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Withania somnifera (WS), well-known traditional medicinal plant, has been used as antistress and infertility treatment. Therefore, the present study looks into the ameliorative effects of WS on the reproductive and immune system of male Coturnix coturnix japonica in stressed conditions like water and food restriction focussing on the modulation in estrogen receptor alpha (ER alpha).Method of study: Biochemical estimations for oxidative stress, histological alterations, immuno-fluorescent localization of ER alpha, interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-4, and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in testicular cells were performed.Results: Nutritional restriction declines endogenous estradiol, ER alpha in testicular cells while it elevates corticosterone leading to oxidative stress in testis thereby reducing fertility by decrease in sperm. Results indicate significant reversal in all the parameters after the administration of WS by improving testicular cell morphology, increased superoxide and catalase activity thus reducing oxidative stress. WS increases spermatogenesis and enhances expression of ER alpha in testicular cells in quail. Further, WS increases IL-4, decreases IL-1 beta and IFN-gamma expression in testis, thereby improving immune profile contrary to stressed conditions.Conclusion: WS stimulates HPG-axis even after stress resulting in increased endogenous estradiol which stimulates the expression of ER alpha in testis; increases sperm count and immunity thereby improving the reproductive performance. WS may be the best therapy against nutritional-restriction stress induced reproductive toxicity by reducing oxidative stress mediated inflammatory response via increased testicular expression of ER alpha in quail.",10.1111/aji.13816,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Insights from a Removal Experiment of Mesocarnivores to Benefit Demographic Parameters of the Pyrenean Capercaillie,PLoS One,10,10,"Mesopredator control has long been used to alleviate the effect of elevated predation pressure on vulnerable, threatened or valuable species. However, the convenience of using mesopredator controls is technically questionable and scientifically-sound research is therefore required to evaluate the impact of predation on prey case by case. In this study we evaluated the effect of the alteration of terrestrial mesopredator dynamics on the demographic parameters of a relict capercaillie Tetrao urogallus aquitanicus population currently in decline for which the impact of predation has not previously been assessed. We used a six-year mesocarnivore removal experiment (2008-2013) together with seven-years of previous demographic information on capercaillies (1999-2007) within a before-after control-impact (BACI) design to evaluate the effect of mesocarnivore removal on capercaillie demographic parameters and on spatial behaviour of the most frequent predatory mesocarnivores of the capercaillie (Martes spp. and red fox Vulpes vulpes). Using a dynamic site-occupancy approach, the reduction of mesocarnivore population levels as a result of removal was clear for marten species, mainly during key months for capercaillie reproduction, but not for the red fox. Our results show that the breeding success of capercaillies was enhanced in areas where carnivores were removed and was inversely related to the occupation level of the studied mesocarnivores, although being only significant for Martes spp. Moreover, capercaillie predation rates were lower and adult survival seemingly higher in treatment during the removal phase. Cost-effective, long-term management interventions to ensure the recovery of this threatened capercaillie population are discussed in the light of the results. At our study area, the decision for implementing predation management should be included within a broader long-term conservation perspective. In this regard, a more feasible and sustainable management intervention in ecological and economic terms may be to balance the impact of mesocarnivores on capercaillies through the recovery of apex predators.",10.1371/journal.pone.0139837,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most compounds currently used as seed treatment in the EU have low acute toxicity but may still affect birds in a sub-chronic or chronic way, especially considering that the sowing season lasts several weeks or months, resulting in a long exposure period for birds. Tebuconazole is a triazole fungicide widely used in agriculture but its toxicity to birds remains largely unknown. Our aim was to test if a realistic scenario of exposure to tebuconazole treated seeds affected the survival and subsequent reproduction of the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa). We fed captive partridges with wheat seeds treated with 0%, 20% or 100% of tebuconazole application rate during 25 days in late winter (i.e. tebuconazole dietary doses were approximately 0.2 and 1.1 mg/kg bw/day). We studied treatment effects on the physiology (i.e. body weight, biochemistry, immunology, oxidative stress, coloration) and reproduction of partridges. Exposed birds did not reduce food consumption but presented reduced plasmatic concentrations of lipids (triglycerides at both exposure doses, cholesterol at high dose) and proteins (high dose). The coloration of the eye ring was also reduced in the low dose group. Exposure ended 60 days before the first egg was laid, but still affected reproductive output: hatching rate was reduced by 23% and brood size was 1.5 times smaller in the high dose group compared with controls. No significant reproductive effects were found in the low dose group. Our results point to the need to study the potential endocrine disruption mechanism of this fungicide with lagged effects on reproduction. Risk assessments for tebuconazole use as seed treatment should be revised in light of these reported effects on bird reproduction. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

We analyse and discuss the apparent success and shortcomings of Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus) rein-troductions in alpine tundra areas of Norway. We followed the fate of 915 foxes between 2007 and 2020 and estimated the apparent survival and reproductive success of captive-bred and released Arctic foxes, compared to wild-born descendants. Relationship to abundance of small rodents, population size, and age were explored. Overall, apparent survival and probability of breeding were similar between captive-bred and wild-born foxes, positively linked to rodent abundance. For wild-born foxes, both breeding propensity and litter size declined with increasing fox population size. This could be a first sign of the limited capacity of single tundra patches to house self-subsistent populations. Thus, facilitating and maintaining connectivity among remnant and re-established Arctic fox populations, creating functional metapopulations, is essential for further improvement and long-term survival. Relying on the combined measures of supplementary feeding and red-fox (Vulpes vulpes) con-trol, the Arctic fox captive-breeding and reintroduction programme has so far been highly successful. However, anthropogenic drivers facilitating red fox invasion into the Arctic fox habitat, along with climate driven irreg-ularities and dampened small rodent cycles, could inhibit the establishment of a self-sustained population.

Access to nutritious foods for juveniles has important implications because poor foraging conditions during development could result in mortality, or reduced fitness in adulthood. Selection of brood-rearing habitats by female Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) thus has broad implications to survival of juveniles and persistence of populations. Previous research using crop contents demonstrated that invertebrates and forbs comprise the major portion of sage-grouse chick diets for the first few months post-hatch. We coupled stable isotope analysis of feathers and field measurements to quantify chick diet and then correlated that with measures of chick body condition. We sought to reconstruct sage-grouse chick dietary history (2013-2015) using nitrogen stable isotopes to (1) evaluate whether selection of brood-rearing habitats by female sage-grouse was related to chick diet, and (2) assess the relationship between dietary consumption and body condition. Brood-rearing females selected habitats in areas where diet resources occurred in proportion to their availability, with the exception that females selected areas with greater forbs abundance 4 weeks after hatch. Diet assimilation by chicks at brood-rearing locations was unrelated to the availability of forbs and invertebrates, but consumption of forbs increased with chick age. Chicks that assimilated proportionally greater amounts of plant-derived nitrogen in their feathers during their first week of life tended to weigh more and have longer wing chords. This relationship was similar between male and female chicks. The importance of quality foods for sage-grouse is well recognized and conservation efforts should aim to maintain functioning sagebrush ecosystems containing adequate brood-rearing habitats for juvenile sage-grouse; there remains a need to identify whether desirable effects are achievable when attempting to improve big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) habitats to benefit sage-grouse populations.",10.1093/condor/duy012,,JRY,Phasianidae,Insect availability,Body condition,No,Measured N from plant material x wing length,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Raccoons (Procyon lotor) and other small carnivores are very attracted to deer feeders and are potential predators of ground-nesting birds such as wild turkeys. We tested the hypothesis that predation on artificial ground nests was greater near deer feeders due to the increased presence of nest predators. We selected 2 ponds and 2 artificial water sources (windmills with troughs) on the basis of habitat similarity. We provided supplemental food in the form of shelled corn at one of each of the pond and windmill sites during 1997, 1998, and 1999. At each site we placed 50 artificial nests (3 chicken eggs) along a 800- X 40-m transect centered on the water source. We monitored the fate of these nests over 28 days. We identified nest predators through patterns of eggshell breakage, hair traps, and automatic cameras. We analyzed nest survival using a logit model and by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Raccoons and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) were the most common predators of the artificial nests. In years with adequate ground cover to conceal the nests, presence of supplemental deer feeders at the site significantly decreased survivorship of the artificial nests. In dry years with sparse ground cover, nest survivorship was extremely poor at all sites. The lack of cover for the nests outweighed any deleterious effects of the deer feeders. Previous studies have suggested that supplementing predators may be a way to reduce nest predation; our results suggest the contrary.

A decade ago we reviewed this ecological question in a paper that focused on phyllosomal development of the western rock lobster, Panulirus cygnus. The main region of occurrence of its metamorphosis was found to be in the slope region beyond the shelf break. Because the puerulus of P. cygnus is a non-feeding stage, it was hypothesised that metamorphosis will not occur until the final phyllosoma has reached some critical, and specific, level of stored energy reserves. For late larval development and successful metamorphosis of P. cygnus, the richest food resources seem to be located in the slope waters adjoining the shelf break off Western Australia. This, like most shelf break areas, is a region of higher zooplankton and micronekton biomass than is usually found further offshore, and is dominated (in winter-spring months) by the warm south-flowing Leeuwin Current. In this new review, distribution and abundance data of final phyllosomas and pueruli are examined from, Panulirus argus, Panulirus cygnus, Panulirus japonicus, Panulirus ornatus and Jasus edwardsii, and where possible, related to features of the satellite imagery of the areas in which they occur. We hypothesise that metamorphosis will occur where the final stages have partaken of sufficient, appropriate nutrition to provide them with a reserve of bioenergetic resources, and this can occur where oceanographic fronts effect greater planktonic productivity and concentrations of food organisms. This may be near the shelf-break, or out to large distances offshore, because of large-scale oceanographic events such as the prevailing current system, its off-shoots, mesoscale eddy fronts, counter-currents, etc. However, we contend that, in terms of population recruitment, metamorphosis in most shallow-water palinurid species occurs mainly in the slope waters adjoining the shelf break of the region to which the species is endemic. Although some final phyllosomas may metamorphose much further offshore, it is unlikely that these pueruli will reach the shore, let alone settle and successfully moult to the juvenile stage. All of the data indicate that successful metamorphosis from the final-stage phyllosoma to the puerulus stage in all species occurs offshore but close to the continental shelf.",10.1007/s11160-008-9099-5,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nest-site choice likely reflects a strategy of predator avoidance: nesting on islands to avoid mammalian predators and near territorial gulls to avoid other avian predators. We observed a nesting colony of Common Eiders from first nest initiation through nesting termination on Egg Island near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska (2002 - 2003). Resident gulls depreciated many eider nests, mostly during initiation. All nests failed when an Arctic Fox (Alopex lagopus) visited the island and flushed hens from their nests, exposing the eggs to depredation by the fox and gulls (resident and non-resident). Common Eiders actively defended nests from gulls, but not from foxes. Likely all three species (i.e.. eiders, gulls. and foxes) ultimately achieved negligible benefit from their nest-site selection or predatory activity: (a) island nesting provided no safety from mammalian predators for ciders or gulls. (b) for Common Eiders, nesting near gulls increased egg loss, (c) for Glaucous Gulls, nesting near colonial ciders may have reduced nest success by attracting the fox, and (d) for Arctic Foxes, the depredation was of questionable value, as most eggs were cached and probably not recoverable (due to damage from fall storms).

B.t.k. kills larvae of Lepidoptera that might otherwise be food. This may effect types of food ingested and influence chick growth rates by reducing the availability of a high-protein food. Amount of ingested grit, which is diet-dependent, may also be influenced, which could alter exposure to anthropogenic toxic metals, such as cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb), associated with the grit. Chick growth rate from 0 to 14 days of age was determined, and gizzard contents were analyzed for types of foods and levels of macronutrients and trace metals in chicks raised in a plot treated with B.t.k. compared to chicks raised on a control plot. Chick growth rates were significantly different (p [<] 0.05); chicks from the treatment plot increased body mass 30% less as compared to chicks raised on the control plot. Control chicks contained on average 2.5-fold the mass (in g) of grit and nearly twofold the mass of food, which included larvae, in their gizzards compared to those exposed to B.t.k. whose diets were dominated by spiders and ants. Concentrations of magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), phosphorous (P), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), sulfur (S) and the trace metals zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), and chromium (Cr) did not differ between experimental and control birds (p [>] 0.05). In contrast, control chicks had higher levels of aluminum (A1), Cd, cobalt (Co), and (pb) in their gizzards than chicks from the sprayed area (p [<] 0.05), attributed to greater amounts of consumed grit. Although birds from the sprayed area had lower levels of the toxic metals Pb and Cd in their gizzards, a protein-deficient diet could have been a factor that contributed to decrease rates of growth in B.t.k.-exposed birds as compared to those birds held on nonsprayed sites.

Trapped adult males had less tendency to leave study areas than adult females, but juvenile males had the most tendency to leave. Movement away was not related to body weight at 1st capture. Initial ranges of juveniles were larger than those of adults. At an estate where 4000 ring-necked pheasants (P. colchicus) are released annually, hawk capture rates and density, hawk weights and rate of predation on pheasants were greater and ranges smaller, than at an estate with only wild pheasants. Goshawks were responsible for an estimated 88% of the 64% overwinter loss among female wild pheasants and for 23% of the 76% loss among males. The predation showed no marked selection of pheasants in poor conditions, but females were selected when the ground was covered with snow. When all kills probably were found, male goshawks ate 133 g/day and females 189 g/day. Wild pheasants accounted for an estimated 43% of the males' food, whereas European hares (Lepus capensis) comprised 37% of the diet of females.

Unlike imported broilers and layers, native Thai chicken, a tropical non-seasonal breeding species, has lower body weight and exhibits strongly maternal behaviors which, in turn, affect feeding behavior during the reproductive cycle. The aim of this study was to investigate the role(s) of NPY that might be associated with the reproductive cycle of female native Thai chickens using immunohistochemistry technique. The distributions of NPY-immunoreactive (-ir) neurons and fibers in the brain of laying and fasted chickens was also elucidated. Changes in body weight and number of NPY-ir neurons in the nucleus paraventricularis magnocellularis (PVN) were compared across reproductive stages. The results revealed that NPY-ir neurons and fibers were distributed throughout the brain with the greatest density located in the PVN. Differences in the number of NPY-ir neurons in the PVN were found across reproductive stages. The numbers were lowest in non-egg laying and egg laying stages and significantly higher during egg-incubating and chick-rearing stages. Changes in body weight were inversely related to the number of NPY-ir neurons across reproductive stages. In addition, food restriction caused an increase in NPY immunoreactivity, confirming the role of NPY in response to food restriction. Taken together, the present findings suggest that the NPYergic system in the PVN plays an important role in the regulation of food intake during the reproductive cycle in this non-seasonal breeding tropical species.",10.1177/1758155920968991,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(3) Counts of adult capercaillie and black grouse during July and August increased by 56-80% after 2 years of predator removal. Counts at leks increased by 166-174%. (4) Removing foxes and martens had no significant effect on vole abundance during two 4-year cycles. (5) When predators were not removed, tetraonid brood sizes and the proportion of females that bred successfully were each positively correlated with vole abundance in summer. There were most chicks per adult hen when vole numbers were high and increasing slowly from summer to autumn. When foxes and martens were killed, neither brood size nor subsequent adult numbers were significantly correlated with vole abundance in summer, although losses of whole broods increased slightly when vole numbers grew most rapidly from summer to autumn. We conclude that large vole populations resulted in large autumn grouse populations mainly because they reduced predation on breeding grouse.

In some areas, secondary land uses such as wind energy developments and opencast quarrying are being considered. The additive effects of such developments have prompted concern among conservationists that eagles will be adversely affected. In this paper, we summarize an approach used to investigate and reduce to acceptable levels the impacts of sheep, forestry, and a planned wind energy development on a territorial pair of eagles in the Kintyre peninsula. Site-specific studies of eagle ranging, diet, and prey distribution indicated: (1) eagle activity was greatest in a contiguous area of high elevation moorland that included part of the proposed wind farm; (2) eagles avoided forest habitats, except where the trees were young, or the stands were small; (3) avian prey, particularly Red Grouse (Lagopus lagopus scoticus), was an important component of diet during a summer in which the eagles bred successfully; and (4) an important population of Red Grouse occupied the proposed wind farm. We concluded that avoidance of the wind farm by eagles would result in the forfeiture of an important prey resource. Alternatively, in the absence of any modification of ranging behavior, eagles were at considerable risk of collision with wind turbines. This paradigm led us to develop a large-scale management scheme with the aim of reducing the cumulative impacts of the various land uses. A key objective of the scheme is to increase the overall number of grouse available to eagles. We intend to achieve this through the conversion of forest habitat to moorland and extensive management of sheep. Simultaneously, the scheme seeks to discourage eagles from entering the wind farm by impoverishing the local habitat for grouse. We suggest that secondary developments such as wind farms sometimes represent an opportunity to enhance landscapes that have been degraded by previous land use decisions.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depredation of nests and predation of chicks can be two of the most influential factors limiting their productivity. Prey species utilize antipredation behaviors, such as predator avoidance, to reduce the risk of predation. Birds in general balance the dual necessity of selecting cover to hide from visual and olfactory predators to enhance prospects of survival and reproductive success, which may also be achieved by selecting habitat with relatively fewer predators. We compared avian predator densities at Greater Sage-Grouse nests and brood locations with those at random locations within available sage-grouse habitat in Wyoming. This comparison allowed us to assess the species' ability to avoid avian predators during nesting and early brood rearing. During 2008-2010, we conducted 10-min point-count surveys at 218 nests, 249 brood locations from 83 broods, and 496 random locations. We found that random locations had higher densities of avian predators compared with nest and brood locations. Greater Sage-Grouse nested in areas where there were lower densities of Common Ravens (Corvus corax), Black-billed Magpies (Pica hudsonia), Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), and hawks (Buteo spp.) compared with random locations. Additionally, they selected brood-rearing locations with lower densities of those same avian predators and of American Kestrels (Falco sparverius), compared with random locations. By selecting nest and brood-rearing locations with lower avian predator densities, Greater Sage-Grouse may reduce the risk of nest depredation and predation on eggs, chicks, and hens.

Understanding the demographic response of free-living animal populations to different drivers is the first step towards reliable prediction of population trends. 2. Penguins have exhibited dramatic declines in population size, and many studies have linked this to bottom-up processes altering the abundance of prey species. The effects of individual traits have been considered to a lesser extent, and top-down regulation through predation has been largely overlooked due to the difficulties in empirically measuring this at sea where it usually occurs. 3. For 10 years (2003-2012), macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) were marked with subcutaneous electronic transponder tags and re-encountered using an automated gateway system fitted at the entrance to the colony. We used multistate mark-recapture modelling to identify the different drivers influencing survival rates and a sensitivity analysis to assess their relative importance across different life stages. 4. Survival rates were low and variable during the fledging year (mean = 0.33), increasing to much higher levels from age 1 onwards (mean = 0.89). We show that survival of macaroni penguins is driven by a combination of individual quality, top-down predation pressure and bottom-up environmental forces. The relative importance of these covariates was age specific. During the fledging year, survival rates were most sensitive to top-down predation pressure, followed by individual fledging mass, and finally bottom-up environmental effects. In contrast, birds older than 1 year showed a similar response to bottom-up environmental effects and top-down predation pressure. 5. We infer from our results that macaroni penguins will most likely be negatively impacted by an increase in the local population size of giant petrels. Furthermore, this population is, at least in the short term, likely to be positively influenced by local warming. More broadly, our results highlight the importance of considering multiple causal effects across different life stages when examining the survival rates of seabirds.",10.1111/1365-2656.12229,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The hypothesis that this difference results directly from their relative adaptations to extreme cold is evaluated and dismissed. An alternative hypothesis is developed from considerations of body size and biogeographic effects on productivity. This suggests that the northern limit of the red fox's geographic range is determined directly by resource availability (and thus ultimately by climate), whereas the southern limit of the arctic fox's range is determined, through interspecific competition, by the distribution and abundance of the red fox. Predictions from this hypothesis are fulfilled, particularly by data on fur harvests. The argument is extended to other pairs of similar canid species, with the conclusion that equivalent interactions between body size, secondary productivity and direct competition have general relevance to their geographical distributions.",10.2307/3545168,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

One cost is that reproduction decreases survival probabilities of attendant individuals, which may have a major effect on population demography. During brood rearing, adults of precocial species usually make extensive movements to lead their young to sites with adequate food resources and dense cover. However, few studies have evaluated the effects of brood movement on attendant precocial adults. In this study, we tracked female Chinese Grouse during brood-rearing periods using radiotelemetry at Lianhuashan Nature Reserve, Gansu, China, during 2010-2012, to evaluate the effects of brood rearing and movement distances on females' survival probabilities using known fate models in program MARK. All 41 females attempted to breed, and 30 females successfully hatched at least one chick; 11 failed during the incubation period. Although females with broods moved more extensively than females without broods, movement distances did not influence survival probabilities of attendant females. Seven females with broods were killed by predators, resulting in a lower survival probability (0.958 +/- 0.016 weekly survival and 0.679 +/- 0.099 through the 9-weeks brood-rearing periods) than for females without broods, which all survived the brood-rearing periods. Our results agree with the prediction of life history theory, which assumes that cost must correlate with reproduction. The extensive movement patterns found in this study might reflect a lack of suitable brood-rearing habitat near nest sites, which might be detrimental to chick survival and influence the persistence of this population.",10.1007/s10336-018-1578-4,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1193,"Reznick, David and Yang, Anthony P.",1993,The influence of fluctuating resources on life history: Patterns of allocation and plasticity in female guppies,Ecology (Washington D C),74,7,"We investigated how resources are allocated to reproduction and how variations in resource availability influence reproductive allocation, offspring number, and offspring size in guppies (Poecilia reticulata). Our goal was to evaluate how plastic these variables are in response to environmental variation and to characterize the nature of this plasticity. Female guppies which had just given birth (litter 1) were assigned to either high or low levels of food availability until they gave birth to their next litter (litter 2, interval 1). They were then randomly reassigned to either high or low food with the constraint that there be equal numbers of individuals in each of four treatments: high-high, high-low, low-high, and low-low. They were maintained on this level of food availability until they produced their next litter (litter 3, interval 2). We analyzed variables that characterized the female after the birth of the third litter and the offspring in the third litter. These were two-way analyses, with intervals 1 and 2 as the main effects and high vs. low food as the levels of each effect. The qualities of the third litter were influenced by both interbrood intervals, indicating that the resources used for producing the litter were derived from both intervals. Specifically, higher food availability during either interval resulted in a significant increase in the number of offspring in litter 3, independent of the size of the mother. This result indicates that the number of offspring produced in a litter will be a function of both the immediate and the past environment. Lower food during either interval resulted in an increase in the number of days between the second and third litters, indicating that, if resource availability is low, the female may delay the initiation of the next litter, allowing her to acquire more resources. Resource availability during both intervals also influenced how resources were allocated to individual offspring. Females responded to low food during the first interbrood interval by producing heavier offspring in litter 3. This increase in mass was almost entirely attributable to an increase in fat reserves. Such a result could represent adaptive plasticity, if it can be demonstrated that maternal fitness increases through the production of heavier offspring in a low-food environment.",10.2307/1940844,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although riparian areas typically make up less than 2 percent of the sagebrush landscape, interspersed springs, streams, and meadows offer watering and feeding sites for sage grouse during summer and early fall. Livestock selectively remove grasses and forbs within the sagebrush landscape while showing a strong preference for riparian meadows once upland vegetation cures. Livestock use can impact the amount and composition of herbaceous understory depending on the class of livestock, season of use, and grazing intensity.

Apart from effects on growth, proactive behaviour and secondary sexual characteristics, the possible negative impacts of maternal testosterone on the immune system are often considered a limitation for its deposition. The effects of maternal testosterone can be modulated by postnatal environmental conditions, such as the availability of food resources. However, the majority of studies considering the effects of maternal testosterone on the immune system have been conducted under optimum conditions. We evaluated the influence of genetic selection for high (HET) and low (LET) egg testosterone content in Japanese quail on immune responsiveness of offspring to phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation under severe protein restriction. Protein restriction negatively influenced body weight and performance in the PHA-test. We observed an increase in Cort (corticosterone) and He/Ly (heterophil/lymphocyte ratio) after LPS, while no changes occurred in total IgY levels in the protein-restricted group. HET quails showed higher body mass and total IgY levels and lower He/Ly ratio than LET quails, while the PHA index and Cort concentration did not differ between lines. No interactions were found between protein restriction and genetic line. In conclusion, the immune response was not compromised under conditions of severe protein restriction in the faster growing HET line compared with the LET line. We hypothesise that the immune responsiveness of birds with higher yolk testosterone may be linked with other maternally-derived substances in a context-dependent manner.

Accordingly, a variety of techniques are used to reduce the impact of nest predation on listed species. We examined the efficacy of conditioned taste aversion, a nonlethal technique designed to induce avoidance behavior in predators after being exposed to prey items that have been treated, usually with a chemical emetic that causes predators to become ill within minutes of consumption. We used carbachol (carbamyl choline chloride) as a taste-aversive agent to condition corvids responsible for high levels of nest predation on 2 federally listed species-the western snowy plover (Charadrius nivosus nivosus) and California least tern (Sternula antillarum browni)-breeding at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California, USA. We conducted 2 separate experiments in 2013 and 2014, during which we deployed 772 artificial nests during the first experiment and 760 artificial nests during the second experiment. Each artificial nest contained 3 quail (Coturnix spp.) eggs. During the first stage of both experiments all of the nests only contained untreated quail eggs, and nest predation was high with >90% of nests failing within 1-2 days of deployment. In subsequent stages, we deployed carbachol-treated eggs in increasing proportion. We used nest survival models to evaluate daily survival rates (DSR) of artificial nests in all stages of both experiments. During both experiments, DSR increased concomitant with a greater proportion of carbachol-treated eggs. Common ravens (Corvus corax) accounted for 98.1% (n = 471) of all artificial nest predations in Experiment 1, and 95.6% (n = 498) of all artificial nest predations in Experiment 2. Using carbachol as a taste-aversive agent was effective at reducing predation on artificial nests as illustrated by increased DSR (0.47 to 0.98 in the first experiment and 0.00 to 0.99 in the second experiment); however, transferability of this technique to plover and tern nests was not fully realized.

Nocturnal motor activity decreased during the fast, while daytime activity first increased and then returned to the original level by the end of the fasting period.

In control birds, the decrease in Tb at the beginning of scotophase was independent of ambient temperature. In the combined data, the level of hypothermia correlated strongly with body mass loss (r = .90), which shows that quail can directly or indirectly sense the amount of body energy reserves.

In this study, we combined tracking data and stable isotope analysis to examine how breeding constraints and prey conditions influenced intrapopulation variation in resource use in a generalist predator, the macaroni penguin Eudyptes chrysolophus. Isotopic variation was also examined as a function of breeding success, individual traits and individual specialisation. Variation in isotope ratios was greatest across multiple tissue types when birds were able to undertake mid-range foraging trips (i.e. during incubation and pre-moult). This variation was highly consistent between years that spanned a 3-fold difference in local prey Euphausia superba density, and was also highly consistent at the individual level between 2 years that had similar prey densities. Furthermore, by comparing our results with previous work on the same population, it appeared that a decrease in local prey availability can also increase intrapopulation variation in resource use during periods with more restricted foraging ranges (i.e. during brood-guard and creche).

To test this hypothesis, the resistance to starvation of JIs of the Caribbean spiny lobster, Panulirus argus, was evaluated by measuring their point of -no-return (PNR, minimum time of initial starvation preventing recovery after later feeding) and point-of-reserve-saturation (PRS, minimum time of initial feeding allowing for food-independent development through the rest of the molting cycle) in a warm and a cold season. Each experiment consisted of eight groups: a continuously fed control (FC) group, a continuously starved control (SC) group, and six groups subjected to differential periods of either initial starvation and subsequent feeding (PNR experiments) or initial feeding and subsequent starvation (PSR experiments).

JIs of P. argus exhibit a remarkable resistance to starvation considering that the previous non feeding, energy-demanding puerulus phase lasts for similar to 3 weeks. However, JIs appear to have a relatively higher degree of dependence on food to complete development to JII during'the cold season than during the warm season. Therefore, JIs of P. argus would appear to be more resistant to starvation during the warm season.",10.7717/peerj.2852,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Ericaceae), is an important food resource for many mammals, insects and birds in forests, including the threatened capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus). For capercaillie, a sufficient amount of bilberry fruits is crucial to store enough body fat for the winter period. Studies have shown that V. myrtillus reproduction is influenced by canopy openness, but specific effects of flower availability, light conditions and pollinators on fruit production remain unclear. We therefore assessed bud, flower and fruit abundance as well as quality traits for V. myrtillus fruits under shade, semi-shade and sun conditions in 12 50 x 50 m plots in the Black Forest National Park, Germany from April to July 2017. We further observed and identified flower-visiting insects and calculated the seed set for fruits.With greater canopy openness, flower buds and fruit abundance increased. The few fruits that developed in the shade had fewer ovules compared to fruits growing under higher light availability. In the sun, seed set was highest, suggesting higher pollinator activity on these microsites. We identified five flower-visiting insect species of the genera Andrena, Bombus and Lasioglossum. The results show that canopy openness can trigger a number of additive positive effects on the number of flowers and hence potential fruits but also their quality due to an enhanced pollinator activity. Active canopy opening could therefore be used to increase bilberry availability for capercaillie. Management plans to support capercaillie populations however, should also consider the time lag between active canopy opening and flowering response in V. myrtillus.",10.1016/j.foreco.2018.10.059,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We hypothesized that the protective effect also could extend to foraging resources, whereby the resultant resource-enriched habitats near a nest of aggressive raptors could be an alternative cause of associations between nesting bird species with non-overlapping foraging niches. In the Arctic, the Rough-legged Hawk (Buteo lagopus) and the Peregrine Falcon (Falco peregrinus) are 2 raptor species with non-overlapping food resources that have been reported to nest sometimes in close proximity. Since nesting Peregrine Falcons are very aggressive, they may protect the small rodent prey near their nests from predation, and Rough-legged Hawks could use these hot spots as a nesting territory. In 2 regions in low Arctic Russia we found that (1) the nesting territories of Peregrine Falcons were indeed enriched with small rodents as compared to control areas, (2) the probability of nest association between the 2 raptors increased when rodent abundance was generally low in the region where hawks did not use alternative prey, and (3) hawk reproductive success increased when nesting close to Peregrine Falcons. These results suggest that implications of aggressive nest site defense in birds in certain cases may involve more mechanisms than previously explored.

L.",2021,Upland rush management advocated by agri-environment schemes increases predation of artificial wader nests,Animal Conservation,24,4,"Farmland birds, including breeding waders, have declined across Europe. One frequently advocated strategy to facilitate population recovery is using agri-environment schemes (AES) to improve vegetation structure. A key example is cutting dense rush Juncus to open the sward which aims to increase the abundance of wading birds, for example by improving foraging conditions. Effects on breeding success are, however, unknown. This is a critical knowledge gap as high nest and chick predation rates are a key driver of wader declines. For wader species that nest across a range of sward structures, for example Eurasian curlew Numenius arquata and common snipe Gallinago gallinago, converting denser swards to more open ones may reduce opportunities for nest concealment and thus increase predation risk. Due to the difficulties of locating large numbers of wader nests, we assess rush management impacts on nest predation risk using artificial wader nests (n = 184) in two upland areas of England, using fields in which rush is managed according to AES prescriptions (treatment; n = 21) or un-managed (control; n = 22) fields. Daily nest predation rates (DPRs) were twice as high in treatment (0.064 day(-1)) than control fields (0.027 day(-1)). Within treatment fields, DPRs were twice as high for nests in cut rush patches (0.108 day(-1)) than in uncut rush (0.055 day(-1)). Modelling links higher DPRs associated with rush cutting to the resultant shorter and less dense vegetation. Our results highlight the need to assess how AES prescriptions that alter vegetation structure impact all aspects of the target species' fitness and thus determine population recovery. Studies using real wader nests should test whether AES rush management inadvertently creates an ecological trap by altering vegetation structure, and identify the sward structure and configuration that optimizes trade-offs between foraging conditions and nest predation risk.",10.1111/acv.12672,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Different mixes of warm-season grasses and forbs were established to improve the habitat quality of fields enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) for gamebirds in the Southern Plains. We analyzed the feeding ecology of human-imprinted, 4- to 10-day-old ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus) and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) chicks in wheat fields and 4 types of conservation practices (CP) fields enrolled in CRP (CP10, improved CP10, CP2, and CP25) in western Kansas, USA, during June and July, 2004 and 2005. Foraging rates were greatest for bobwhite chicks in improved CP10 and CP25 fields and greatest for pheasant chicks in CP10 and CP25 fields. Vegetation characteristics such as bare ground cover appear to have a significant impact on insect selection, because the diet was more diverse for both species in fields with more bare ground. The CP25 fields provided the best combination of mobility and diet breadth for both species. Although herbicide-treated wheat fields had low feeding rates, we determined non-herbicide-treated fields (i.e., weedy wheat) provided easy mobility and feeding rates similar to CRP fields. We suggest that management of vegetation to benefit gamebirds does not affect species equally. Feeding rates of bobwhite chicks were sensitive to vegetation-influenced mobility. Management of CRP fields for both pheasant and bobwhite chicks can be reconciled by practices that permit more open space at ground level, such as light disking or burning, to permit easier movement for chicks.",10.2193/2008-522,,JRY,Phasianidae,Insect availability,No,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Iss. SI,"This study presents a complex approach for modeling the natural evolution of a population in terms of population number and dynamics of the genetic structure. A set of dynamic models that consider various types of natural selection was applied to describe possible mechanisms underlying the formation of existing genetic variations in litter sizes in coastal, inland, and farmed arctic fox populations (Alopex lagopus, family Canidae, order Carnivora). The r-K selection model for uniform population and the models with natural selection were assessed on various life cycle stages in a two-age population. The life cycle of arctic fox was fitted to the population model with two age stages. The different reproductive potentials and survivability of progeny on the early stage of life cycle were genetically determined using the model with a single diallelic gene. A monomorphism was obtained for a considered characteristic in a population of coastal arctic fox with constant food supply. Meanwhile, a polymorphism with cyclic fluctuations in population number and gene frequency was obtained in inland arctic fox populations, which could be due to cyclic fluctuations of prey. In farmed fox populations, the considered gene becomes pleiotropic (defines the survival rate of individuals on early and late stages of the life cycle) because of artificial selection performed by farmers to increase the reproductive success of breeders. The application of an appropriate model (with selection by pleiotropic gene) can be used to determine the elimination rate of low litter size alleles from the farmed populations. The possible applications of the proposed models for formulating and solving optimal control tasks in arctic fox populations are discussed too. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Other significant prey were copepod eggs, nauplii, copepodites and adults, gastropod veligers, and Oikopleura sp. Mean numbers of prey in the guts of S. meleagris medusae (bell height ranged from 1.5 to 10 cm) varied from 200 to 9300. Numbers of prey were an exponential function of medusan biomass, increasing from 700 prey at 9 g wet weight to 6000 prey at 325 g wet weight. Mean numbers of ingested prey ranged from 4000 to > 65 000 prey day-1 medusa-1. Bivalve veligers made up 47% of the daily ration. The daily ration was estimated to range from 20 to 100 mg C medusa-1, depending on size of the medusa. Bivalve veligers were selected over all other kinds of prey.

The grey partridge is a species of conservation concern, in common with many farmland birds. Its widespread decline in western Europe has been attributed to agricultural intensification. Attempts to restore populations have concentrated upon habitat management. In France, a mosaic of strips planted with maize- or kale-based mixtures is widely used to benefit the grey partridge on intensively cultivated farmlands. The rationale for planting these summer-to-winter cover strips is to increase the overwinter survival rate and hence breeding density. Although this policy is costly to apply, there is little information on its effectiveness. 2. We tested effectiveness of this management scheme as a practical way of improving or restoring partridge populations. We present data from a 6-year before-after control-impact (BACI) experiment replicated across four study sites. We monitored partridge populations to estimate breeding density, reproductive success and overwinter mortality. 3. During the course of the study, no partridge population increase occurred on managed areas compared with control areas. Wildlife cover strips did not improve reproductive success but were associated with higher overwinter 'apparent mortality' rates. 4. Some field data suggested that there was a predation risk at cover strip-field edges. Cover strips may concentrate a number of species within small isolated areas and may act, under some circumstances, as an ecological trap for prey species such as the grey partridge. Due to these complex and unforeseen interactions, this habitat management measure proved unsuitable for partridge restoration. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study has demonstrated the necessity of field experiments at a farm-scale to test the effectiveness of habitat management schemes. A priori assumptions based on smaller scale studies, even if they are supported by some field evidence, can be misleading because they fail to capture the emergent properties of larger scale systems. This study is a specific illustration of how the BACI approach is a powerful tool for addressing wildlife management problems at large spatial scales.",10.1111/j.0021-8901.2004.00939.x,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Where they occur, they damage agricultural crops and wildlife habitat. Wild pigs also depredate native wildlife, particularly ground-nesting bird species during nesting season. In areas inhabited by wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo), nest destruction caused by wild pigs may affect recruitment. There is debate whether wild pigs actively seek ground-nesting bird nests or depredate them opportunistically. To address this debate, in 2016 we examined the movements of wild pigs relative to artificial wild turkey nests (i.e., control (no artificial nests), moderate density (12.5-25 nests/km2), and high density (25-50 nests/km2)) throughout the nesting season (i.e., early, peak, and late) in south-central Texas, USA. We found no evidence that wild pigs learned to seek and depredate wild turkey nests relative to nest density or nesting periods. Despite wild pigs being important nest predators, depredation was not a functional response to a pulsed food resource and can only be associated with overlapping densities of wild pigs and nests. Protecting reproductive success of wild turkeys will require reducing wild pig densities in nesting habitat prior to nesting season.

The management of these highly productive animals must be optimal to allow their full genetic potential to be expressed. If this is not done, inefficient production and several metabolic diseases such as ascites become apparent. The causes of the ascites are multifactorial but diet and, particularly, interactions between diet, other environmental and genetic factors play an important role. The relatively high heritability estimates for ascites-related traits and the significance of maternal genetic effects for most of the traits indicate that direct and maternal genetic effects play an important role in development of the ascites syndrome. An imbalance between oxygen supply and the oxygen required to sustain rapid growth rates and high food efficiencies causes ascites in broiler chickens. Because of the relationship to oxygen demand, ascites is affected and/or precipitated by factors such as growth rate, altitude (hypoxia) and environmental temperature. As the high metabolic rate (fast growth) is a major factor contributing to the susceptibility of broilers to ascites, early-age feed or nutrient restriction (qualitative or quantitative) or light restriction in order to slow down the growth rate seem practically viable methods, since final body weight is not compromised. Manipulation of the diet composition and/or feed allocation system can have a major effect on the incidence of ascites. Optimization of the house temperature and ventilation in cold weather seem helpful practices to decrease ascites incidence.",10.1080/03079450801902062,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,Domestic chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the first time this species was found nesting in the Kruglaya Bay, the overused recreation area in Sevastopol (Black Sea). Our investigation detected factors determining the breeding efficiency, food spectrum, behavioral responses and the duration of stay of the little bittern in the biotope exposed to high anthropogenic load. Visual observations, photography and video recording were conducted five times a week within the Kruglaya Bay. Two adult I. minutus were observed from July 3 to August 2, and three immature birds - from July 24 to September 7, 2016 in the bay head.

During this period macaroni penguins at this site ate a diverse diet, dominated by myctophid fish and two krill species, whereas chinstrap penguins were Antarctic krill specialists. The population changes are probably primarily due to the expanding Antarctic fur seal population, and also to landslides that are the result of increased melting on the island which have destroyed penguin breeding sites. Additional impacts from global warming of the ocean might also be playing a role and could exacerbate the decline in these penguin populations if krill and other prey are negatively impacted in the future in this region.

We explored sources of variation in egg allocations of female Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) in the American Great Basin over a 10-yr period, as well as range-wide variation in clutch size, using our data and other published values. We tested for environmental and individual effects on clutch size (n = 390) and egg volume (n = 2,486) in a mixed-modeling framework, with random-effect terms that described variation among individual females (i.e. heterogeneity) and allowed us to calculate repeatability for clutch and egg size. The strongest influence on clutch size was the timing of nest initiation, which varied by as much as 67 days within years and showed a negative linear relationship with clutch size. Once this pervasive effect was accounted for, we also found positive effects of annual precipitation and nest-site elevation. In wetter years and at more productive high-elevation sites, females laid larger clutches, which suggests that some degree of large-scale resource availability affects clutch size. The fixed effects in our models explained [approximately]34% of the total variance in clutch size, and individual random effects explained an additional 15% (repeatability = 0.15). In contrast to clutch size, little measurable variation in egg volume could be attributed to the fixed effects we considered, and [approximately]60% of the variance in egg volume was associated with random effects (repeatability = 0.59). Prenesting female body condition influenced clutch size, and this effect was most pronounced for replacement clutches.

The causes of lead ammunition ingestion in Bonelli's eagle (Aquila fasciata) and its effects on breeding success were studied in one of the most important populations of this endangered species in Europe. Regurgitated pellets belonging to different pairs from 2004 to 2014 were analyzed, both in the breeding (1363 pellets from 12 territories) and non-breeding (172 pellets from 9 territories) seasons. From these territories, 57 molted feathers to study lead contamination were analyzed, and breeding success was monitored for 41 breeding attempts. The occurrence of lead shots in pellets was detected using X-ray photographs. Pellets were also used to describe eagle diet. Lead shots in pellets were present in 83.3% of the territories. The frequency of occurrence of lead shots in pellets (2.81% in spring and 1.31% in autumn) was primarily related to the consumption of red-legged partridge in the breeding season (when partridges are hunted from blinds using calling lures), and secondarily to rabbit consumption in the non-breeding season (coinciding with the main hunting season). Thus, our results indicate that injured small-game were the main source of lead contamination in the Bonelli's eagle. For the first time for a raptor species, a positive relationship between the frequency of occurrence of lead shots in pellets and lead concentration in eagles' feathers has been documented. Lead concentration in feathers (mean +/- SD: 816 +/- 426 mu g kg(-1), with no sex-related differences) was high for a species that rarely eats carrion or aquatic birds ( the main prey-related lead source for raptors). This had negative effects on breeding success, which could jeopardize Bonelli's eagles in other European populations that are sustained by juvenile dispersal from the study population. Our work shows that some game modalities pose a potential threat to endangered raptors. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",10.1016/j.scitotenv.2017.09.069,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1219,"Hall, April E. and Clark, Timothy D. (timothy.clark.mail@gmail.com)",2016,Seeing is believing: metabolism provides insight into threat perception for a prey species of coral reef fish,Animal Behaviour,115,NA,"Responding appropriately to predator threat is a critical survival skill for all organisms. Under-responding can result in death, while continually over-responding can waste precious energy reserves and compromise important life history attributes such as growth and reproduction. This trade-off becomes particularly pertinent in predator-rich environments such as coral reefs, yet almost nothing is known of the sublethal physiological responses that coral reef predators elicit in their prey. To address this knowledge gap, we designed equipment and protocols to measure the metabolic responses of a common coral reef fish (juvenile ambon damsel, Pomacentrus amboinensis) to chemosensory and visual stimuli of a common predator (adult yellow dottyback, Pseudochromis fuscus). Pomacentrus amboinensis did not exhibit a metabolic response to the chemosensory predator stimulus, yet there was a consistent and significant metabolic response to the visual stimulus that endured for at least 24 h if the predator remained visible. A complete lack of metabolic response of P. amboinensis to the visual stimulus of a nonpredatory wrasse, Halichoeres argus, revealed an impressive ability of juvenile P. amboinensis to rapidly discriminate between similar-sized predatory and nonpredatory fishes. These divergent metabolic responses of P. amboinensis were not explained by measureable differences in their swimming behaviour in the predator versus nonpredator treatments, yet prey that were exposed to repeat predation attempts (predatory strikes) had the strongest metabolic response to the predator. Our findings demonstrate the capacity of coral reef fishes to interpret predator cues and prioritize threats and actions. Moreover, this study is the first to demonstrate that high predator densities on coral reefs could result in repetitive short-term or even chronic long-term elevations in energy expenditure of prey communities.

We examined microhabitat partitioning in six sets of steppe birds associated to agroecosystems in central Spain (female and male Great Bustards Otis tarda, female and male Little Bustards Tetrax tetrax, Red-legged Partridges Alectoris rufa and Eurasian Stone-curlews Burhinus oedicnemus) to estimate realized niche breadth, overlap and segregation. Principal Components Analysis on data from used and random microhabitat locations produced two axes we retained for analysis related with two key factors: cover-visibility and food availability. Non-parametric kernel density functions were calculated for each of the PCA axes and species (or sexes), and niche overlap estimated as the area shared between species' density functions. Null models were run to evaluate overlap significance. In analyses of microhabitat selection by the six sets of birds, 13 out of 15 pairs had significant resource partitioning and niche segregation, except for the pairs partridge and female Great Bustard and the two sexes of Great Bustard. Eurasian Stone-curlew showed wider trophic niche breadth, although segregated from the other species, probably because of its higher invertebrate requirements. Great and Little Bustards segregated in both niche axes, selecting microhabitat according to their body size. Accessibility to food resources and shelter seems to be similar for partridges and female Great Bustards, overlapping in their selection, which may indicate the existence of segregation in other niche factors (e.g., feeding habits). Great Bustard males showed niche overlap with females. Little Bustard males showed feeding microhabitat selection patterns similar to those of females, although they preferred more open microhabitats to meet their sexual display requirements. The entire assemblage had significantly less overlap than expected by chance, suggesting that differential microhabitat selection and realized niche partitioning may explain coexistence in steppe bird communities. Our results suggest that the maintenance of different microhabitat structure should be a priority in the management of agricultural environments.",10.1556/168.2015.16.2.5,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The white-tailed sea eagle population has been monitored since 1974 by the Norwegian Ornithological Society, and the population is increasing. The levels of pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls are low in the eggs of both the golden eagle and the gyrfalcon, but elevated levels and effects on reproduction have been indicated for a coastal subpopulation of golden eagle. The pollutant levels in white-tailed sea eagle are lower than in the Baltic population of sea eagles, and shell thinning was never severe overall, but individual eggs have contained pollutant concentrations above critical levels. The levels of pollutants in the bird-eating falcons, peregrine, and merlin were higher than in other species.

Domestication is an ongoing process during which adaptations to changing environments occur over generations. Food deprivation by their caretakers is less for domestic chickens than for their junglefowl ancestors. Unlike domestic chicken, the junglefowl adapted over generations to periods of food deprivation, which may be reflected in differences in metabolic responses to brief periods without food. Here, we compared the blood glucose and plasma levels of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) among four populations when deprived of feed for 16 h. The four populations included a domestic White Rock experimental line (LWS) maintained for generations under ad libitum feeding, adult red junglefowl (RJF), and a reciprocal cross of the lines. Although there were significant differences in adult (31-week) body weight between the RJF (683 g) and LWS (1282 g), with the weight of F-1 crosses being intermediate, the amount of abdominal fat relative to body weight was similar for all populations. Patterns for blood glucose responses to a glucose bolus after a 16-h fast were similar for the initial and final points in the parental and cross populations. However, RJF reached their peak faster than LWS, with the reciprocal cross intermediate to the parental populations. Plasma NEFA concentrations were higher after the 16-h fast than in fed states, with no population differences for the fasting state. However, in the fed state, NEFA levels were lesser for LWS than for others, which was reflected further in percentage change from fed to fasted. This larger change in LWS suggests differences in mobilization of energy substrates and implies that during domestication or development of the LWS line, thresholds for responses to acute stressors may have increased.",10.2141/jpsa.0180098,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The breeding success of Finnish grouse has been in decline for decades. While it has been shown that fragmentation and modern forestry practices such as clear-cutting affect the viability of grouse populations, little is known about effects of large-scale drainage. The drainage network in Finland has increased dramatically during the past decades. By 1988, 6 million ha of bog ecosystems had been drained. This is likely to have had a profound direct and indirect effects on grouse productivity. Because ditches persist in time, large-scale drainage may therefore have strong potential for affecting the long-term breeding success of three forest grouse species in Finland.2. Using a mixed-model approach on nation-wide data, we estimate the effects of drainage on breeding success of three grouse species for the period from 1966 to 1988. The possible additive effect of precipitation is investigated using regional precipitation data. For each species, we compare a set of hypotheses and select the best model(s) according to the Akaike information criterion.3. For all species, the model which included the main effects of both ditch density and precipitation outperformed the models with just one of the main effects as well as the interaction model. The effects are restricted to southern and central Finland, where drainage is most intensive.4. The effects of drainage are likely to be both direct and indirect, but the mechanisms are less clear. Both bottom-up, such as decreased availability of insect food, and top-down effects, such as increased predation risk, may account for indirect effects. Direct effects are likely to involve drowning of chicks.5. Synthesis and applications. Bogs are classified as key biotopes by the European Union, and Finland is obliged to maintain their favourable conservation status and to protect typical bog communities. While this goal may be achieved for state-owned land, restoration of drainage systems on private land continues. Considering the persistence of ditches, new legislation are therefore needed to favour the recovery of former bogs and mires on private land as well as to protect remaining ones.",10.1111/j.1365-2664.2007.01396.x,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1230,"BROWN, LESLIE H. and WATSON, ADAM",1964,The golden eagle in relation to its food supply,IBIS,106,-1,"The population of golden eagles was assessed in 4 different areas of the Scottish Highlands. The average area per pair varied from 11,400 to 17,884 acres, excluding country that was not used by the eagles. Eagle food in these areas consists largely of red grouse, ptarmigan, mountain hares and rabbits, and also dead red deer and dead sheep. The numbers and biomass of the 4 main species of living prey were assessed by representative counts in 3 main types of habitat; and of dead deer and sheep partly from counts but mainly from published data on stocking densities, mortality and weights. The annual food requirement from a home range was estimated at 249 kg. of meat, calculated from data on the food consumption of eagles, allowing for known breeding success and for the presence of some immature eagles and unmated adults; and this was compared with the total food potential in the 4 study areas, allowance being made for the inedible portions of carcases. The average food potential in all areas is greatly in excess of the requirements. In the 3 western areas living prey is very scarce, but amounts of carrion are large and the eagles in these areas depend mainly on carrion. Large differences in food potential between areas do not correspond with differences in eagle density. Two examples are cited where a drastic reduction in food supply had no effect on eagle density, which remains remarkably constant in spite of seasonal and annual fluctuations in food supply. Golden eagle nest-sites are used over many years, and the home ranges are big enough to supply a more than adequate food supply at all times of year. Evidence is provided of territorial or home-range defence, which generally takes the form of display flights but occasionally involves more overt aggression. The home-range size is fixed so high that a critical food level is probably very rarely reached. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Authors",10.1111/j.1474-919X.1964.tb03682.x,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Muscle (or total body homogenates of potential fish and invertebrate prey) was analyzed for stable carbon (delta C-13) and nitrogen (delta N-15) isotopes to establish trophic interactions within the Arctic food chain. Food web magnification factors (FWMFs) and biomagnification factors for selected predator-prey scenarios (BMFs) were calculated to describe pathways of heavy metals in the Alaskan Arctic. FWMFs in this study indicate that magnification of selected heavy metals in the Arctic food web is not significant. Biomagnification of Cd occurs mainly in kidneys; calculated BMFs are higher for hepatic THg than renal THg for all predator-prey scenarios with the exception of polar bears (Ursus maritimus). In bears, the accumulation of renal THg is approximately 6 times higher than in liver. Magnification of hepatic Ag is minimal for all selected predator-prey scenarios. Though polar bears occupy a higher trophic level than belugas (Delphinapterus leucas), based on delta N-15, the metal concentrations are either not statistically different between the two species or lower for bears. Similarly, concentrations of renal and hepatic Cd are significantly lower or not statistically different in polar bears compared to ringed (Phoca hispida) and bearded seals (Erignathus barbatus), their primary prey. THg, on the other hand, increased significantly from seal to polar bear tissues. Mean delta N-15 was lowest in muscle of Arctic fox (Alopex lagopus) and foxes also show the lowest levels of Hg, Cd and Ag in liver and kidney compared to the other species analyzed. These values are in good agreement with a diet dominated by terrestrial prey. Metal deposition in animal tissues is strongly dependent on biological factors such as diet, age, sex, body condition and health, and caution should be taken when interpreting magnification of dynamic and actively regulated trace metals.

Consequently, Canis species can exert strong effects on prey populations locally because of their year-round maintenance of territories. We assessed prey use by coyotes (Canis latrans) by sampling scats from within known territories in southeastern Alabama and the Savannah River area of Georgia and South Carolina. We accounted for the size and habitat composition of coyote home ranges to investigate the influence of space use, vegetation density, and habitat type on coyote diets. Coyote use of prey was influenced by a combination of mean monthly temperature, home range size, vegetation density, and hardwood forests. For example, coyote use of adult white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) was associated with cooler months and smaller home ranges, whereas use of rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.) was associated with cooler months, larger home ranges, and less vegetation density. Coyotes in our study relied primarily on nutritionally superior mammalian prey and supplemented their diet with fruit when available, as their use of mammalian prey did not appreciably decrease with increasing use of fruit. We suggest that differential use of prey by coyotes is influenced by habitat heterogeneity within their home ranges, and prey-switching behaviors may stabilize local interactions between coyotes and their food resources to permit stable year-round territories. Given that habitat composition affects coyote prey use, future studies should also incorporate effects of habitat composition on coyote distribution and abundance to further identify coyote influences on prey communities.",10.1371/journal.pone.0203703,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Phenotypic plasticity allows animals to handle environmental changes. However, the patterns of flexibility in metabolic rates and its ecological consequences under different predator stress and food availability conditions are poorly understood. Here, we used crucial carp (Carassius auratus) as a prey species and northern snakehead (Channa argus) as a predator to test whether predator stress influences metabolism and growth, and alters the link between flexibility in metabolic rate and its ecological consequences (e.g., growth) in crucial carp. The experiment was carried out under the conditions of predator stress (with or without a predator) and three food availabilities (satiation feeding 1 time per day, low food availability; 2 times per day, intermediate food availability; and 3 times per day, high food availability) for 3 weeks. After 21 days of feeding, the final body mass and body length in the two treatments increased compared to the initial values in all three food availabilities. The feeding intake (FI) and specific growth rate (SGR) of the two treatments increased with increasing food availability. The control treatment had a higher FI and SGR than the predator stress treatment in all three food availabilities. The feeding efficiency (FE) of the two treatments was higher at the high and intermediate food availabilities than at the low food availability. However, no effect of predator stress on FE was detected. The final values of original or standardized SMR were higher in the control treatment than the predator stress treatment at the intermediate and high food availabilities. The changes in SMR ([DELTA]SMR) were higher in the control treatment than in the predator stress treatment. The positive correlation between the [DELTA]SMR and SGR was found in the intermediate food availability in the predator stress treatment, suggesting that individuals with a higher flexibility in SMR had a larger growth rate and vice versa, but this relationship was dependent on food availability. Our results suggest that predator stress decreased maintenance metabolism, feeding and growth of juvenile crucial carp irrespective of food availability. Predator stress does not alter the growth advantages conferred by the metabolic plasticity of the fish under changing food availability.",10.1016/j.cbpa.2019.02.016,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Water was provided ad libitum for all treatment groups. 2. The daily allowance for R birds increased from 26 g per bird at 2 weeks of age to 94 g at 21 weeks. The intake of AL birds meanwhile increased from 65 g at 2 weeks to 240 g at 19 weeks, before decreasing to about 200 g at 21 weeks. 3. Median heat productions (H) per bird in the R and 2R treatment groups were, respectively, 65 and 40% lower than in the AL when adjustment was made for the reduced food intake of AL birds in the calorimeter chambers. The effects of dietary treatment on fasting H were proportionally similar. 4. Because the increasing divergence in body weights would have made a large contribution to differences in H per bird, the results were adjusted to the median weight of 2.03 kg and to unit weight (1.00 kg). Adjusted fasting heat production was 18 and 11% less in 2R and R birds than in those fed ad libitum. 5. If age was included as a variate in the logarithmic multiple regression, H was proportional to body weight (W, kg) raised to the power 0.73; if age was not included, H was proportional to W-0.55. 6. Rectal temperature was 0.7 degree C higher in AL birds at ambient temperatures of both 23 and 28 degree C. All treatment groups had a higher rectal temperature at 28 degree C than at 23 degree C, with the AL birds most affected. 7. Foot surface temperature of R birds at an ambient temperature of 23 degree C was 8 degree C lower than that of the 2R and AL groups, indicating peripheral vasoconstriction. 8. Polypnea (panting) and wing-extension occurred frequently in the AL birds, which also had a greater water intake. It was also observed that the restricted birds tended to aggregate, while the AL groups tended to space themselves evenly about the pen. 9. It was concluded that broiler breeder fowl responded to restricted food intake by a reduction in heat production over and above that resulting directly from reduced metabolism of food and reduced body weight. The reduced metabolic rate per unit of weight conferred a thermoregulatory advantage at high ambient temperature.",10.1016/0300-9629(93)90503-V,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,Domestic chicken,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eagle Hg levels showed great variation, reflecting primarily differences in diet composition and food chain biomagnification. Concentrations were positively correlated with the dietary proportion of insectivorous and omnivorous birds (e.g. egrets, corvids and thrushes), with very low levels for pairs feeding mainly on herbivores (e.g. rabbits, pigeons and partridges). Differences in prey contamination among breeding territories added to dietary effects in determining variation of Hg levels in eagles, shaping a spatial pattern that was largely consistent with a source of contamination in a coal-burning power-plant lying upwind of the study area. Despite this presumed contamination, Hg levels seemed to be of little concern to this eagle population, though there might be subtle deleterious effects on the reproductive output of a few pairs.

Here we test the hypotheses that high tree diversity in a large deciduous forest enhances bird diversity and nest survival. We further expect that forest edges support higher bird diversity when different habitat types adjoin, whereas nest predation is not higher, because the large forest area mitigates potential edge effects. We studied how edge-centre differences and tree diversity (beech-dominated vs. tree-species rich) affect the bird community and survival rates of ground breeding birds' nests based on an artificial nest predation experiment in the Hainich National Park, Germany. We surveyed birds three times during the breeding season. We selected six forest stands with low tree diversity (i.e. dominated by beech) and six with high tree diversity (i.e. tree-species rich). Each forest stand contained four bird survey plots (plot 1: 0-30 m, plot 2: 60-90 m, plot 3: 120-150 m and plot 4: 180-210 m distant from edge; altogether 48 bird survey plots). Additionally each plot corner contained one artificial ground nest baited with one Blue-breasted Quail egg and one plasticine egg for eight days of exposure in the middle of the breeding season. Bird abundance and diversity were higher in the first 30 m of the forest. Bird diversity, including ground breeding birds, was also enhanced by higher percentages of bushes, which can provide enhanced food supply, perches as well as sheltering. Nest predation showed no edge effect, supporting the idea that small area of forest fragments causes more important negative effects than the edge in large forest remnants. Predation rates were higher in tree-species rich stands compared to beech-dominated stands, probably due to greater diversity and density of mammalian predators. Edge effects shaped the bird community composition and positively affected abundances of tree and shrub breeding birds, but did not affect ground breeders and the nest predation of ground nests. Shrub breeders accumulating in forest edges might, however, suffer more from nest predation in forest fragments. In conclusion, bird diversity and avian egg predation were affected by both forest edges and tree diversity in surprisingly different ways. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, relative costs and benefits of alternative foraging strategies vary with the abundance, accessibility, predictability and nutritional value of anthropogenic food sources. The extent to which such strategies may ultimately alter fitness, can have important consequences for long-term population dynamics. Here, we studied the relationships between parental diet and early development in free-ranging, cross-fostered chicks and in captive-held, hand-raised chicks of Lesser Black-backed Gulls (Larus fuscus) breeding along the Belgian coast. This traditionally marine and intertidal foraging species is now increasingly taking advantage of human activities by foraging on terrestrial food sources in agricultural and urban environments. In accordance with such behavior, the proportion of terrestrial food in the diet of free-ranging chicks ranged between 4% and 80%, and consistent stable isotope signatures between age classes indicated that this variation was mainly due to between-parent variation in feeding strategies. Astronger terrestrial food signature in free-ranging chicks corresponded with slower chick development. However, no consistent differences in chick development were found when contrasting terrestrial and marine diets were provided ad libitum to hand-raised chicks. Results of this study hence suggest that terrestrial diets may lower reproductive success due to limitations in food quantity, rather than quality. Recent foraging niche expansion toward terrestrial resources may thus constitute a suboptimal alternative strategy to marine foraging for breeding Lesser Black-backed Gulls during the chick-rearing period.",10.7717/peerj.7250,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1242,SMITH T G,1987,THE RINGED SEAL PHOCA-HISPIDA OF THE CANADIAN WESTERN ARCTIC,Canadian Bulletin of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences,NA,216,"I studied ringed seals, Phoca hispida, during the years 1971 to 1983 from Holman in Amundsen Gulf, N.W.T., and several other localities in the southeastern Beaufort Sea. The highest densities of ringed seals (2.84/km2) were found in Prince Albert Sound, Amundsen Gulf. Each year this becomes an area of good stable landfast ice which is consistently used as a breeding habitat. Age structure of the catches indicates segregation of older animals occupying fast-ice areas in the winter and spring, with all age classes being present in the summer open-water period. In the autumn, young-of-the-year and adolescents move west along the coast of Amundsen Gulf and southeastern Beaufort Sea. Seals tagged in this study were recovered as far west as Point Barrow, Alaska [USA] and Injun, Siberia [USSR]. Prime breeding ice in Amundsen Gulf is characterized by being stable with ice hummocks or pressure ridges which provides areas for accumulation of snow in which subnivean lairs are constructed. Lairs serve the dual function of providing protection from predators and as a thermal shelter. Both polar bears, Ursus maritimus, and arctic foxes, Alopex lagopus, kill seals in their lairs. Arctic foxes are the most important predators of ringed seal pups in the western Canadian arctic. Strong territoriality exists in the breeding habitat. A limited form of polygyny exists in the ringed seal breeding population; one male maintains a territory which includes several females with their sub-territories of birth-lair complexes. A significant decrease in the number of birth lairs found during dog searches was documented in 1974 and 1975. In 1975 it was also found that the number of lairs occupied by rutting males was severely reduced. Predation by arctic foxes was at a peak in the spring of 1973, one year prior to the highest fox trapping harvest yet recorded for the area. High fox predation continued in the springs of 1974 and 1975 even though the number of ringed seal pups born had been severely reduced. Ringed seal pups are born in mid April. Ovulation occurs on average, 21 May, with implantation of the blastocyst on 18 August. There is an active gestation of 241 days with a delay of implantation of 89 days. Females are sexually mature at 5.61 years with the mean age of first reproduction being attained at 7.67 years. The pup sex ratio at birth is 1:1. Mean reproductive rates in normal years are calculated as 0.56. In 1974 and 1975 ovulation rates were reduced to the low values of 0.41 and 0.38, respectively, compared to the mean rate of 0.89 in other years. The index of body condition of adult seals was also significantly reduced in both 1974 and 1975. The length at birth of seals in this study area is calculated to be 632 mm (STL) with a foetal growth rate of 2.2 mm/day; post-natal growth to weaning is 6.1 mm/day; and post-weaning growth is reduced to a low of 0.099 mm/day for the remainder of the year. There is an indication of severe stunting in 4% and moderate stunting in 11% of the seals measured in this study. It appears to be related to date of birth and poor feeding conditions during the first year of life. Ringed seals feed on a variety of crustaceans during the open water season including Parathemisto libellula, Thysanoessa raschii and Mysis oculata. Arctic cod, Boreogadus saida, is the most important food of all ages of ringed seals during the ice covered period. There is evidence of feeding competition between adolescents and adults as shown by different prey items and diurnal feeding times. All age classes lose body condition from spring through to early September. Autumn feeding on arctic cod by groups of adult ringed seals occurs regularly, and this is an important time for the seals to regain body condition. It is also probably the proximate cause, through territorial exclusion, of the migration of young and adolescents westward along the mainland coast towards the Beaufort and Bering Seas. Survivorship values estimated from catch curves do not present either a clear or accurate picture of the annual changes in a rin.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Food intake was determined by direct observations and converted into biomass intake. Comparison between intake and biomass availability of the various food items revealed that the lizards were selective, and that changes in seasonal food availability led to periodic switching of food plants. The extent to which nutrient constraints determine iguana feeding ecology was investigated. Potential constraints were the requirements for water, digestible crude protein, and metabolizable energy. By using a linear programming model that incorporates characteristics of the food (chemical composition, energy content, item size) and requirements and constraints of the green iguanas (nutrient and energy requirements, digestive tract capacity, feeding rate) it was possible to identify which factors determine food choice over the year. During the dry period, when the iguanas had no access to drinking water they consumed flowers to increase water intake, though the amount of flowers consumed was too low to cover maintenance requirements for either energy or protein. After the young leaf flush, following the early rains in May, the biomass increased, free surface water was available during showers, and the linear programming solutions indicate that food selection conformed to the protein maximization criterion. Reproduction in green iguanas shows an annual cycle, in which oviposition takes place at the end of the dry season, when intake is below maintenance levels. Females show a 8-10 month gap between acquisition of most of the protein required for egg synthesis and the act of laying. Thus, as in avian and mammalian herbivores, food availability during a period prior to the energy and protein demanding reproductive season of iguanas determines reproductive success.",10.1007/BF00323497,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Time and space constraints might exist, however, if fewer food resources are available to meet the costs of reproduction early during the reproductive season. Here, for the first time, we test whether nutrient-allocation strategies for reproduction in a shrub-dependent avian species differ with timing of breeding in different ecoregions: a high-elevation landscape, containing spatially complex vegetation (Rocky Mountains) vs. a low-elevation, more homogenous landscape (Great Plains). We analyzed data collected from radio-telemetry and stable isotopes to assess the degree to which endogenous (body) reserves are used for reproduction and whether variation in allocation strategies was associated with time of year, ecoregion, habitat quality (including sagebrush type and plant greenness), or maternal characteristics. Using a Bayesian statistical framework, we found that females relied on a similar amount of endogenous reserves for reproduction in first nesting and renesting attempts. Additionally, endogenous contributions declined more rapidly throughout the nesting season in the Rocky Mountains than in the Great Plains. Individuals in high- and intermediate-elevation sagebrush types in the Rocky Mountains used similar amounts of endogenous reserves, whereas females nesting in low-elevation sagebrush used less. Females nesting at intermediate elevations, which experience the greatest flush of new green vegetation during the nesting season, switched their reliance from endogenous-to-exogenous sources for reproduction as green vegetation became available during spring. Our study highlights adaptations of a nutrient-allocation strategy across areas with varying levels of resources in time and space in a habitat specialist bird. Nutrient allocation by individuals residing in high-elevation areas favors a strategy that mainly uses nutrients gained from wintering habitats, whereas individuals residing in low-elevation areas mainly use exogenous sources for reproduction.",10.1002/ecs2.3700,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, in quail, in which other studies have shown that most thyroid maturation occurs during the embryonic and perihatch periods, the circulating concentrations of T-3 and T-4 showed little posthatch ontogenic change. Plasma concentrations of both GH and IGF-I showed similar patterns in both species with a posthatch rise (peak at 3 days in starlings and 8 days in quail), followed by a decline. Food restriction to maintain body weight resulted in decreased plasma concentrations of T-3 and IGF-I in both species.

Synchrony is also found in long-term fluctuations of northern goshawk brood size and offspring sex ratio. Moreover, synchrony is found in annual numbers of grouse juveniles and adults, the main prey for the northern goshawk. In the brood size and offspring sex ratio of the goshawk, as well as in the annual numbers of grouse juveniles and adults the degree of synchrony falls off with increasing distance. However, only in sex ratios and in grouse dynamics are the slopes of synchrony vs distance roughly matching. We also found that sex ratio either vs grouse juveniles or grouse adults has a more matching spatial dimension (50 km radius) that sex ratio vs brood size.

Increased nest predation has been suggested as another important factor in the decline of farmland birds. High abundances of alternative prey species, such as European Rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus may attract generalist predators, which may increase predation rates on bird nests, a phenomenon known as hyperpredation. In this work, we evaluate artificial nest predation in intensively farmed olive orchards, using quail eggs (one plaster and two natural eggs in each nest) placed on the ground (97 nests) and on trees (106 nests). 53.7% of nests (109 out of 203) were predated; 51 of these nests had at least one egg with signs of predation and in 58 nests all eggs were predated. Nests placed on the ground (61%) were predated more frequently than those on trees (46%). Rabbit abundance was identified as one of the main factors increasing the probabilities of a nest being predated. Despite lower rates of nest predation in areas with low rabbit abundance, we found a higher diversity of nest predators, such as Mustela nivalis, Mustela putorius, Martes foina or Erinaceus europaeus in these areas. This study suggests that conservation efforts aimed at increasing the breeding success of farmland birds should avoid areas with high abundance of rabbits owing to the phenomenon of hyperpredation.",10.3161/00016454AO2015.50.2.005,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We predicted a decrease in the size of male goshawks from the 1960s because availability of their main prey, grouse, has decreased since then and grouse have been replaced in the diet by smaller prey during the breeding season. Based on the assumption that winter is the most critical period for females, we predicted that female size should have increased because their winter diet consisted of more and more mountain hare, which is a prey generally larger than grouse. Analyses revealed that male size has indeed decreased since the 1960s, while adult females have increased in size. Our data suggest that these morphological shifts were the result of selective pressures due to changes in diet. We also found changes in the (size-independent) shape of the hawks. Relative wing and tail lengths of adult hawks became longer between 1980 and 1990 compared with the 1960-1970 period, while relative juvenile wing and tail lengths tended to decrease. As a result of these morphological changes size dimorphism between the sexes increased from the 1960s to the 1990s.",10.1007/s004420050941,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nine diets including three levels of metabolizable energy (ME, 11.30, 12.13 and 12.97 MJ ME kg(-1)) each at three levels of EAA (low, medium and high) in a 3 x 3 factorial design were formulated. Each diet was offered to 4 replicated groups up to 5 weeks of age. The ratio of lysine to protein and the level of methionine and threonine to lysine remained almost similar in all the diets as specified by NRC [NRC, 1994. Pages 44-45 in Nutrients requirements of poultry. 8th ed. Natl. Acad. Press, Washington, DC.]. Body weight gain, feed intake and feed conversion ratio did not differ statistically due to the treatments i.e. interaction of ME and EAA levels. However, there was linear increase in body weight gain with increased EAA levels during 0-3 or 0-5 weeks of age. Feed intake increased linearly with the decreased ME (P<<0.01) and increased EAA (P<0.01) in diets. Feed conversion ratio (FCR) improved (P<0.01) linearly with increase in dietary ME concentration from 0-3 or 0-5 weeks of age. FCR and energy efficiency improved in diets with medium and high levels of EAA during 0-3 weeks, while it did not differ during 0-5 weeks of age. Protein efficiency (PE) improved linearly (P<0.01) with decreased EAA levels during 0-3 or 0-5 weeks of age, and also with the increase in dietary ME level during 0-5 weeks growth phase. Nitrogen retention per unit energy intake was significantly higher in diet containing 12.97 MJ ME kg-1 with high level of EAA. Humoral (SPBC) and cellular (PHA-P) immune response and yield of immune organs did not differ due to ME, EAA or MExEAA. Therefore, it can be concluded that the optimum level of dietary ME is 11.30 MJ kg(-1) with CP 25.83%, lysine 1.49%, methionine 0.58% and threonine 1.17% on dry matter basis during 0-5 weeks of age for gain. However for optimum feed conversion, the growing quails require diet with ME 12.97 MJ kg(-1) with CP 23.23%, lysine 1.30%, methionine 0.50% and threonine 1.02% for 0-5 weeks of age.

This idea has largely been invoked to explain animal migration patterns, yet the general phenomenon underlies trends in vertebrate reproductive chronology as well. We evaluated the utility of this hypothesis for predicting spatial variation in nest initiation of greater sage-grouse (Centrocerus urophasianus), a species of conservation concern in western North America. We used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to map the green wave across elevation and then compiled dates and locations of >450 sage-grouse nests from 20 study sites (2000-2014) to model nest initiation as a function of the start of the growing season (SOS), defined here as the maximum daily rate of increase in NDVI. Individual sites were drawn from three ecoregions, distributed over 4.5[degree] latitude, and spanning 2,300 m in elevation, which captured the climatic, edaphic, and floristic diversity of sagebrush ecosystems in the southern half of current sage-grouse range. As predicted, SOS displayed a significant, positive relationship with elevation, occurring 1.3 days later for each 100 m increase in elevation. In turn, sage-grouse nest initiation followed SOS by 22 [plus or minus] 10 days (r2 = .57), with hatch dates falling on or just prior to the peak of the growing season. By timing nesting to the green wave, sage-grouse chicks hatched when the abundance of protein-rich invertebrate biomass is hypothesized to be nearing a seasonal high. This adaptation likely represents a strategy for maximizing reproductive success in the arid, variable environments that define sagebrush ecosystems. Given projected changes in climate and land use, these results can be used to predict periods of relative sensitivity to habitat disturbance for sage-grouse. Moreover, the near real-time availability of satellite imagery offers a heretofore underutilized means of mapping the green wave, planning habitat restoration, and monitoring range conditions.",10.1002/ece3.6758,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many studies have hypothesized indirect trophic impacts, but few documented those impacts. We evaluated invertebrate abundance as a factor limiting juvenile survival of the endangered Attwater's prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus cupido attwateri), and whether fire ants reduce invertebrate numbers and biomass. From 2009-2013, we monitored survival of Attwater's prairie-chicken broods (n=63) with radio telemetry during the first 2 weeks post-hatch and collected daily invertebrate samples at brood sites. Broods located in areas with the highest median invertebrate count (338 invertebrates/25 sweeps) had a survival probability of 0.83 at 2 weeks post-hatch compared to 0.07 for broods located in areas with the lowest median invertebrate count (18 invertebrates/25 sweeps). During 2011-2012, we evaluated the reduction of fire ants on invertebrate numbers and biomass by aerially treating areas with Extinguish Plus in an impact-reference study design. Treated fields had 27% more individual invertebrates and 26% higher invertebrate biomass than reference fields. Our results clearly document that invertebrate abundance affects Attwater's prairie-chicken brood survival and that fire ants may indirectly contribute to low brood survival by suppressing invertebrate abundance.

However, few published studies have explicitly examined factors that influence chick survival. We used a suture method to radiomark 1-2-day-old sage-grouse chicks (n = 150) in 2005-2006 on Parker Mountain in south-central Utah, USA, and monitored their survival to 42 days. We modeled effects of year, hatch date, chick age, brood-female age, brood-mixing, and arthropod abundance on chick survival. Our best model revealed an average survival estimate of 0.50 days to 42 days, which is the highest level ever documented for this long-lived species. Brood-mixing occurred in 21% (31/146) of chicks and 43% (18/42) of broods we studied. Moreover, yearling females had more chicks leave their broods than did adults. We found that survival may be higher among chicks that switch broods compared to those that stayed with their natal mother until fledging. Thus, brood-mixing may be an adaptive strategy leading to increased sage-grouse chick survival and higher productivity, especially among chicks born to yearling females. Our findings also indicate that arthropod abundance may be an important driver of chick survival, particularly during the early brood-rearing period and, therefore, sage-grouse populations may benefit from a management strategy that attempts to increase arthropod abundance via brood habitat management.",NA,"""However, all b’is in top models were imprecisely estimated (95% CIs overlapped zero), which may have occurred because of our restricted sample size (n 5 59 survival periods) and, thus, we were not able to attain precise estimates of these biologically important relationships.""",JRY,Phasianidae,Insect availability,Reproductive success,Yes,NOT USED b/c incomplete stats reported,2005-2006,"Parker Mountain - south-central Utah, USA,",,,high-elevation plateau largely dominated by black sagebrush,Sage Grouse,,,breeding,Volume displacement,Pitfall Traps,Ground-dwelling inverts,continuous,No,1259a

The proportion of golden eagle pairs with successful breeding and the number of young produced per occupied territory varied greatly between years (21-85% and 0.27-1.24, respectively). In the northern study area a significant correlation between the proportion of pairs with successful breeding versus total hunting bag of small game species was found. There were also significant correlations between vole density and breeding success 1 yr later. This was not the case in the southern study area, mainly due to a good reproductive year for golden eagles in 1977 when small game species were scarce.

Ptarmigan abundance declined six-fold and was mirrored by a significant decline in Gyrfalcon breeding success (breeding failure 58%, clutch desertion 33%). Clutch size showed little variation, although deserted nests held fewer eggs than did successful nests, and there were more four-egg clutches when ptarmigan were most abundant. An average of 2.26 young fledged per nest during abundant ptarmigan years, and 0.l8 when ptarmigan were declining. No other factors were correlated with Gyrfalcon reproductive success. Juvenile ptarmi- gan density had a compensatory effect: even when ptarmigan breeding numbers dipped, Gyrfal- cons bred successfully if the proportion of juvenile ptarmigan was high. Clutch initiation date was a good predictor of Gyrfalcon breeding performance. Early clutches had more eggs (67% with 4 eggs compared to 27% in late nests), were less likely to be deserted (5% vs. 59%), and fledged more young (93% vs. 38%). Two Gyrfalcon pairs, supplemented with food in a poor ptarmigan year, fledged young at a rate and schedule comparable to pairs during a peak ptarmigan year.

It is thus important to assess the impacts of agricultural intensification on food supply for these species and to uncover the links between changes in food supply and abundance of insectivorous farmland birds. Such an assessment was the goal of this review. Homogenization of diet supplied to the nestlings reduces their growth rate resulting in their smaller size at maturity; decreased abundance of prey affects both survival and body condition of the chicks and the overall breeding performance. Food accessibility (in terms of suitable sward height) is one of the most important factors limiting the use of food-rich habitats. However, the impact of all these factors on population trends has been convincingly shown in a single species - the Grey Partridge (Perdix perdix). While the effect of changes in food supply on the breeding performance was confirmed in many species, subsequent links to the fledgling survival are lacking and the major causes of mortality outside the breeding period remain unclear. In general, there is insufficient information on population consequences of the changes in food supply for farmland birds, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. Based on the reviewed studies, we recommend the reduction of pesticide use and the increase of farmland habitat heterogeneity to improve the food supply for insectivorous farmland birds.",NA,,JRY,Phasianidae,Insect availability,Reproductive success,No,"Review paper, not research",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In 2007 approximately 116.7 km2 (37.2%) of suitable prey habitat remained within this radius.

While these measures have each been associated with feeding ecology in larger carnivorans (e.g., proportion of bone in the diet), they have yet to be combined in any study and have rarely been applied to smaller species or those from high latitudes. Arctic foxes from the north and south of the peninsula, and those from rodent peak and trough density periods, are compared to assess impact of changes in food availability across space and time. Results indicate that microwear textures vary in dispersion, with more variation in texture complexity, including higher values (suggesting more consumption of bone), in the rodent-poor period in the north of Yamal. Gross wear scores and tooth breakage are also significantly higher for the north of Yamal than the south.

The abundances of generalist predators have been positively associated with the abundance of gamebirds. These relationships have implications for prey populations, with the potential for indirect impacts of gamebird releases on wider biodiversity. To understand the basis of these associations, we investigated variation in territory size, prey provisioning to chicks, and breeding success of common buzzards Buteo buteo, and associations with variation in the abundances of free-roaming gamebirds, primarily pheasants Phasianus colchicus, and of rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus and field voles Microtus agrestis, as important prey for buzzards. The relative abundance of gamebirds, but not those of rabbits or voles, was weakly but positively correlated with our index of buzzard territory size. Gamebirds were rarely brought to the nest. Rabbits and voles, and not gamebirds, were provisioned to chicks in proportion to their relative abundance. The number of buzzard chicks increased with provisioning rates of rabbits, in terms of both provisioning frequency and biomass, but not with provisioning rates for gamebirds or voles. Associations between the abundances of buzzards and gamebirds may not be a consequence of the greater availability of gamebirds as prey during the buzzard breeding season. Instead, the association may arise either from habitat or predator management leading to higher densities of alternative prey (in this instance, rabbits), or from greater availability of gamebirds as prey or carrion during the autumn and winter shooting season. The interactions between gamebird releases and associated practices of predator control and shooting itself require better understanding to more effectively intervene in any one aspect of this complex social-ecological system.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is possible that in periods of low water vole densities the carnivore population may switch to other prey like capercaillie young.

Provisioning behaviour is an important aspect of parental expenditure. We show that Macaroni Penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus have clear sex-specific differences in provisioning behaviour. Females provision chicks throughout rearing and at higher rates than males, which only participate in the later stages. Female provisioning is consistent throughout chick-rearing and appears to relate to a threshold rate governing whether or not chicks survive. The additional expenditure by males (but not females) during the creche period influenced chick growth and fledging mass of survivors. We suggest a very simple model to account for these sex-specific differences and effects. Interannual variation in parental expenditure resulted in differences in reproductive output between years. Years of lowest expenditure resulted in lowest growth rate of chicks. Sex-specific differences in provisioning were similar among years, however, with a consistent proportion of expenditure by males.",,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Nest success was not influenced by lemming abundance in the current or previous year as predicted by the ""bird-lemming"" hypothesis. Reducing arctic fox abundance through targeted management increased nest survival of Canada Geese; a result that further emphasizes the importance of arctic fox as nest predators in this system. The spatial distribution of nest predators, at least for dispersed-nesting geese, may be most important for nest survival, regardless of the abundance of small mammals in the local ecosystem.

Sympatric pheasants are expected to share narrower niche space and face more extensive interspecific competition. However, little work has been undertaken simultaneously to investigate niche partitioning among sympatric pheasant species across multiple ecological dimensions. We compared microhabitat use, activity pattern and foraging strategy of sympatric Blood Pheasant Ithaginis cruentus, Buff-throated Partridge Tetraophasis szechenyii and White Eared-pheasant Crossoptilon crossoptilon on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China, to identify potential interspecific niche partitioning along different ecological dimensions in the breeding season. We found that the Buff-throated Partridge differed significantly from the other two species in microhabitat use, and the three species showed different foraging strategies. It is likely that niche partitioning reduced potential interspecific competition, thus facilitating the species' stable coexistence. Our study provides practical evidence of multidimensional niche theory within sympatric ground-dwelling pheasant species, emphasizing that species interactions and coexistence within a guild are often not uni-dimensional.

Sporadic food data was also used from years 1965[long dash]1988. Number of studied territories raised from 12 to 37 during the study years. Food remains were collected from territories at least three times per year: in spring (around the nesting site, n = 1420), in summer (from the nest after chicks fledged, n = 1782) and late summer (around the nesting site, n = 826). Winter diet was assessed by telemetry and from museum samples (n = 88). Diet composed mainly of grouse species totalling highest in spring, around 50%, and lowest in winter, around 30%, by number. Black Grouse were the most numerous among grouse, but juvenile grouse outnumbered them during late summer. Preference of different grouse species in Goshawk's diet was measured by a simple catch/supply index. Willow Grouse was taken twice more among grouse than their abundance in the field suggested, while Black Grouse and Hazel Grouse were taken at the same ratio as their abundance in the field. Capercaillies (only females) were taken around half compared to their relative abundance. Goshawk's functional response (grouse found/nesting site as a response variable) against grouse density of the previous autumn was typically concave. Occupancy rate and productivity (chicks fledged/occupied territory) of the Goshawk territories declined as the grouse density declined but brood size remained at the same level. Combining functional and numerical responses for total response (kill rate) declined as well with grouse density implying that Goshawk's predation impact on grouse has remained in a stable level. During years 1989[long dash]1998 year to year variation of total response tended to lag grouse density by two years, which implies destabilising effect of the Goshawk on grouse population. After 1999 this pattern, however, disappeared when grouse density fell to a very low level. Applied for the whole period, correlation with two year lag was observed but it was far from significant.

The few long-term studies of common eider breeding ecology indicate that reproductive success is low in most years, interrupted by occasional boom years. However, no study has explicitly examined the drivers of long-term variation in reproductive success. Here, we use encounter history data collected across 41years to examine the effects of arctic foxes (a terrestrial nest predator), local abundance and spatial distribution of lesser snow geese (an alternative prey source), and spring climate on common eider nest success. Eider nest success declined over the course of the study, but was also highly variable across years. Our results supported the hypothesis that the long-term decline in eider nest success was caused by apparent competition with lesser snow geese, mediated by shared predators. This effect persisted even following a large-scale exodus of nesting geese from the eider colony. Nest success was also lowest in years of low arctic fox index, presumably driven by prey switching in years of low small mammal availability. However, increased snow goose abundance appeared to buffer this effect through prey swamping. The effect of spring climate depended on the stage of the breeding season; cold and wet and warm and dry conditions in early spring were correlated with decreased nest success, whereas warm and wet conditions in late spring increased eider nest success. These results underscore the significance of both trophic interactions and climate in regulating highly variable vital rates, which likely have important consequences for population dynamics and the conservation of long-lived iteroparous species.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Buzzard sightings increased during the study, in line with their national recovery, whereas Peregrine and Raven showed little change in abundance. The results of our study highlight that management for Red Grouse can benefit both Hen Harrier and Merlin.

The percentage of different birch parts in late winter crop contents, and their chemical composition, varied significantly between years. Annual variation in winter diet composition as well as the fat level of grouse were to a large extent related to food abundance. Multiple regression equations showed that 92-96% of the observed variability in grouse fat levels was accounted for by the yield of mountain birch shoots and catkins. In spring, large annual variation in species composition of the food was related to variation in the in vitro digestibility. This food quality parameter was positively correlated with the size of the fat reserves of breeding females, which in turn was related to breeding success, indicating that maternal nutrition affects Willow Grouse reproduction.

When considering vertebrates, important concerns constrain a comprehensive understanding of the functioning of predator-prey relationships worldwide; e.g. studies simultaneously quantifying 'functional' and 'numerical responses' (i.e., the 'total response') are rare. The functional, the numerical, and the resulting total response (i.e., how the predator per capita intake, the population of predators and the total of prey eaten by the total predators vary with prey densities) are fundamental as they reveal the predator's ability to regulate prey population dynamics. Here, we used a multi-spatio-temporal scale approach to simultaneously explore the functional and numerical responses of a territorial predator (Bonelli's eagle Hieraaetus fasciatus) to its two main prey species (the rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus and the red-legged partridge Alectoris rufa) during the breeding period in a Mediterranean system of south Spain. Bonelli's eagle responded functionally, but not numerically, to rabbit/partridge density changes. Type II, non-regulatory, functional responses (typical of specialist predators) offered the best fitting models for both prey. In the absence of a numerical response, Bonelli's eagle role as a regulating factor of rabbit and partridge populations seems to be weak in our study area.

We combined [approximately]28,000 raven point count surveys with data from more than 900 sage-grouse nests between 2009 and 2019 within the Great Basin, USA.

Concurrently, we modeled sage-grouse nest survival using a hierarchical frailty model as a function of raven density and other environmental covariates that influence the risk of nest failure. Raven density commonly exceeded 0.5 ravens km-2 and increased at low elevations with more anthropogenic development and/or agriculture. Reduced sage-grouse nest survival was strongly associated with elevated raven density (e.g., >0.5 ravens km-2) and varied with topographic ruggedness, shrub cover, and burned areas. For conservation application, we developed a spatially explicit planning tool that predicts nest survival under current and reduced raven numbers within the Great Basin to help direct management actions to localized areas where sage-grouse nests are at highest risk of failure.

We studied nest survival of lesser snow (Anser caerulescens caerulescens) and Ross's (A. rossii) geese at Karrak Lake, Nunavut, in Canada's central Arctic, 1995-2012. We monitored nests throughout the nesting period, from early egg-laying to late incubation, and revisited nests after predicted hatch dates to determine nest fate. Despite high nesting density and high nest visibility, detection of failed nests was lower than active nests; consequently, Mayfield nest success estimated with Program MARK was always lower than apparent nest success, the latter defined as the proportion of detected nests that produced >=1 offspring. From data that included nests found after failure, however, annual nest survival estimated by Program MARK was related (r2 = 0.98 for both species) to apparent estimates, permitting accurate estimation of true nest success from apparent estimates. Nest survival probability (i.e., nest survival) in both species modeled with Program MARK varied annually (lesser snow geese = 0.234-0.795, Ross's geese = 0.273-0.901) and daily nest survival declined with nest age in most years. Within years, nests initiated later experienced lower survival for both lesser snow and Ross's geese (nest initiation date (NID), [beta]NID = -0.068 (95% CI = -0.096, -0.041) and -0.082 (-0.119, -0.046), respectively).

Second, differences in prey frequency and productivity among pairs was analysed, finding an interpair shift in both variables, but there was no relationship between the frequency of prey-species in the diet and productivity. Third, it was found that the percentage of European wild rabbit in the diet was less correlated with its abundance in territories than with the surface of open land in the same.

This expansion of energy development has unknown influences on local wildlife populations and the ecological interactions within and among species. Our objectives for this study were to evaluate nest success and nest predator dynamics of sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus) in two study sites that represented areas of high and low energy development intensities in North Dakota. During the summers of 2012 and 2013, we monitored 163 grouse nests using radio telemetry. Of these, 90 nests also were monitored using miniature cameras to accurately determine nest fates and identify nest predators. We simultaneously conducted predator surveys using camera scent stations and occupancy modeling to estimate nest predator occurrence at each site. American badgers (Taxidea taxus) and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis) were the primary nest predators, accounting for 56.7% of all video recorded nest depredations. Nests in our high intensity gas and oil area were 1.95 times more likely to succeed compared to our minimal intensity area. Camera monitored nests were 2.03 times more likely to succeed than non-camera monitored nests. Occupancy of mammalian nest predators was 6.9 times more likely in our study area of minimal gas and oil intensity compared to the high intensity area. Although only a correlative study, our results suggest energy development may alter the predator community, thereby increasing nest success for sharp-tailed grouse in areas of intense development, while adjacent areas may have increased predator occurrence and reduced nest success. Our study illustrates the potential influences of energy development on the nest predator prey dynamics of sharp-tailed grouse in western North Dakota and the complexity of evaluating such impacts on wildlife.",NA,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No difference was found, however, between adult and yearling female willow ptarmigan (L. l. alexandrae) in date of clutch initiation, clutch size, hatching success, number of fledged young or territory size. Adult females defended their broods more vigorously, and more were observed with broods, a situation suggesting that more yearlings lost their eggs or young and did not renest. Pairs composed of 2 adults produced more fledged young than did pairs composed of 2 yearlings, but clutch size and date of clutch initiation were similar in the 2 groups. The following factors may allow yearlings to reproduce almost as successfully as adults: a reduction in competition with adults for territories because of high population turnover, the presence of extensive male parental care and precocial young, and a dependence on a food source that is readily available and can be obtained without specialized foraging skills.",10.2307/4086912,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Crustaceans were the main prey accounting, for over 90% of the diet by mass. Antarctic krill Euphausia superba was the main prey, in 17 out of 22 years. Amphipods Themisto gaudichaudii were the main prey in 1994 and 2009, fish in 2004, and the euphausiids Thysanoessa spp. and Euphausia frigida in 2000. There was no clearly dominant prey group in 1999. Prey diversity and the frequency occurrence of T. gaudichaudii both increased with a decreasing proportion of E. superba in the diet. There was strong evidence that macaroni penguins have a sigmoidal functional response, indicating that this kind of response should be accounted for when devising ecosystem-based management reference points for seabirds. The energy and mass of all euphausiids combined (rather than E. superba in particular) in the diet were the most reliable predictors of chick fledging mass; the correlation between model-predicted and observed values was 0.84. The gross energy content of individual meals was often above average in years when the diets contained fewer euphausiids, but fledging mass was always below average in these years. Although macaroni penguins are able to feed on a variety of prey types, chick growth was always severely impacted by a shortage of euphausiids due to higher energy or time costs associated with feeding on alternative prey types. Given their reliance on euphausiids, macaroni penguins would be particularly vulnerable to potential climate-driven declines in krill stocks.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These birds are mainly associated with lowland cereal farms, but they are also found on marginal hill farms in northern England where they frequent rough grasslands created by low-intensity sheep farming. Here, important populations remain, but the availability of winter food, particularly in years with prolonged snow appears a major limiting factor. To investigate whether food shortages in winter limit grey partridge survival, we experimentally tested whether we could improve their survival by increasing the provision of supplementary food within five study plots, each paired with a control, over two consecutive winters. Grey partridges found and used feeding stations, with discovery time on average 12 days earlier in the second winter. The frequency of hopper use also increased on four of the five fed plots in the second winter. We found no differences in an index of over-winter survival nor subsequent breeding success in relation to the feeding treatment. However, the study coincided with two mild winters with little snow and the provision of supplementary food may be more important in more severe winters with prolonged snow cover.

This paper presents data from the Siberian tundra showing that this relationship may not be so simple as generally thought. The data consist of parameters of small mammal population fluctuations (small mammal density (SMD), average body weight, species diversity and rate of change of species diversity), inter-specific competition and meteorological factors (mean temperature and snow melt date) during every stage of the breeding cycle of the rough-legged buzzard (Buteo lagopus). The density of breeding pairs was found to be correlated with the SMD, whereas the total number of territorial pairs including non-breeding ones could be most accurately predicted by a model incorporating both the SMD and the population density of a larger competitor, the snowy owl (Nyctea scandiaca). Clutch size showed no correlation with the SMD. The best-fit multiple regression model to predict clutch size includes only small mammal diversity and its rate of change as predictive factors. Number of nestlings and egg losses did not show any correlation with any of the prey-related or weather parameters. Although the total number of rough-legged buzzard fledglings produced per unit area showed a significant positive correlation with the SMD in a single-factor regression, the most accurate multiple regression model to predict overall reproductive output included only the rate of change of the small mammal species diversity.

At the same time, a widespread encroachment of Aleppo pines (Pinus halepensis) to Mediterranean shrubland occurred. Such changes in vegetation structure may affect passerine predator assemblage and densities, and in turn impact passerine densities. Depredation during the nesting season is an important factor to influence passerine population size. Understanding the effects of changes in vegetation structure (pine encroachment) on passerine nesting success is the main objective of this study. We do so by assessing the effects of Aleppo pine encroachment on Sardinian warbler (Sylvia melanocephala) nest depredation in Mediterranean shrublands. We examined direct and indirect predation pressures through a gradients of pine density, using four methods: (1) placing dummy nests; (2) acoustic monitoring of mobbing events; (3) direct observations on nest predation using cameras; and (4) observation of Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius) behaviour as indirect evidence of predation risk. Results We found that Aleppo pine encroachment to Mediterranean shrublands increased nest predation by Eurasian jays. Nest predation was highest in mixed shrubland and pines. These areas are suitable for warblers but had high occurrence rate of Eurasian jays. Conclusions Encroaching pines directly increase activity of Eurasian jays in shrubland habitats, which reduced the nesting success of Sardinian warblers. These findings are supported by multiple methodologies, illustrating different predation pressures along a gradient of pine densities in natural shrublands. Management of Aleppo pine seedlings and removal of unwanted trees in natural shrubland might mitigate arrival and expansion of predators and decrease the predation pressure on passerine nests.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the natural environment of the ancestors, fitness (reproductive success) is often favoured by an ability to locate and remember food sites, whereas in captivity, fitness may be more related to the ability to grow and reproduce efficiently under stable food conditions. We hypothesized that domestication and selection for production traits have caused animals to react less actively to food shortage. In this experiment, 26 red junglefowl (RJF) and 27 White Leghorn layers (WL), the latter selected for high egg production, were exposed to 0, 3 and 24 h of food deprivation while housed in furnished cages. After food deprivation, we quantified the bird's behaviour, in a series of tests. Birds of both breeds performed more foraging-exploring, less preening behaviour and less perching with increasing length of food deprivation. However, when tested in a group, RJF showed a more active response than WL to food shortage by reducing perching time and increasing the foraging and exploration time on the ground, which may be interpreted as a more risk-prone behaviour. Furthermore, when tested individually, there was a breed effect on response in the open field and the novel object tests, where RJF were more cautious than WL. The results may reflect different feeding strategies: the behaviour of RJF would probably be more adaptive in a natural environment, while the behaviour shown by WL may allow more investment in production traits in a more predictable environment.

The main prey of the arctic fox in Fennoscandia are cyclic small rodents, and its number of litters and litter size vary depending on the phase of the rodent cycle. In this experiment, we studied if the arctic fox adjusts its reproduction as a direct response to food abundance, in accordance with the food limitation hypothesis, or if there are additional phase-dependent trade-offs that influence its reproduction. We analysed the weaning success, i.e. proportion of arctic fox pairs established during mating that wean a litter in summer, of 422 pairs of which 361 were supplementary winter fed, as well as the weaned litter size of 203 litters of which 115 were supplementary winter fed. Females without supplementary winter food over-produced cubs in relation to food abundance in the small rodent increase phase, i.e. the litter size was equal to that in the peak phase when food was more abundant. The litter size for unfed females was 6.38 in the increase phase, 7.11 in the peak phase and 3.84 in the decrease phase. The litter size for supplementary winter-fed litters was 7.95 in the increase phase, 10.61 in the peak phase and 7.86 in the decrease phase.

Three prey species, the brown hare (Lepus europaeus), the hamster (Cricetus cricetus) and the pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), seem to have especially important role in the diet of imperial eagles in Hungary, although their relative frequencies varied greatly among different regions. We found that eagles were less productive in a region where hamster was the main prey (West Zemplen Mts) as compared to a recently colonized hare-dominated region (Heves Plain), suggesting that hares may provide a better food source than hamsters.

We studied the influence of temporal variation and habitat management (i.e., burning and strip-disking) on the availability of potential arthropod prey for brooding northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) in the mixed-grass prairie of western Oklahoma. Burning changed the composition of the arthropod community by biomass, but disking did not result in any community-level changes. Burning also increased the total abundance and biomass of arthropods collected compared with the control, but disking did not affect total abundance or biomass. Temporal variation exerted a broader influence on arthropods, and total abundance and biomass increased throughout the duration of the sampling period (May-July) at paired burn/control and paired disked/control sites. Ants, which had the highest abundance and biomass of any taxa, appeared to drive these patterns. The response of individual orders to management and temporal variation varied in size and direction, though we observed more and stronger effects of temporal variation than burning or disking. These results support the idea that burning provides benefits to foraging bobwhite broods through increased total availability of arthropod prey, as well as favorable habitat characteristics (i.e., bare ground, structural heterogeneity). Large temporal variation in total arthropod abundance and biomass, as well as that of individual orders, likely also influences the relative importance of individual prey items in the bobwhite diet based on the timing of nest initiation and hatching. A better understanding of how these temporal and management-induced shifts in arthropod availability influence potential nutrient gains and limitations for bobwhites will require data on macronutrient content and digestibility (i.e., exoskeleton) of prey taxa.

Presumably, poor recruitment due to high predation of nests and chicks is one important causal factor. In a southeastern Norwegian forested landscape (Fjella), we provided diversionary food to predators - directed mainly at the red fox Vulpes vulpes - during the nesting and early brood season of capercaillie Tetrao urogallus and black grouse T. tetrix in three nearby areas. In Eidsberg, where populations were censused during 33 years (1985-2017), food was provided during the last 22 years. In two other areas, a six-year experimental program was conducted (2003-2008) by providing food in one area for three years, then switching feeding to the other area for three years. During May and June, 10 kg of food - mainly moose offal and ungulate carcasses - was deposited at feeding stations once a week. In Eidsberg, black grouse breeding success increased by 43% after feeding was initiated, mainly due to larger brood sizes. In capercaillie, overall breeding success tended to increase, solely due to more females successfully rearing chicks. In the experimental areas, feeding increased breeding success an estimated 57% in black grouse. In capercaillie there was also a tendency for a positive effect, but sample sizes were too small for statistical inference. No increases were detected in adult birds. However, in capercaillie, increased breeding success after feeding led to a significant skew in sex ratio favouring males. A similar tendency in black grouse suggested source-sink dynamics and a net loss of young females during natal dispersal. We conclude that diversionary feeding of foxes in spring and early summer might be a feasible management tool to increase the reproductive output in local grouse populations, but that it needs to be implemented on a larger scale in order to improve breeding numbers.",NA,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,Predation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specialization toward food resources is commonly observed in predator species, both at population and individual levels. When predation of livestock occurs, human-wildlife conflicts rise and livestock producers require efficient management of predators. In the Bresse region (eastern France), free-ranging poultry farms annually suffer from losses due to predation of chickens by several bird and mammal species, including red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). We quantified the diet of several red foxes in this region and investigated dietary specialization on chicken using stable isotope analysis. Vibrissae (i.e. whiskers) of 68 wild foxes sampled throughout the year were cut into fragments to measure inter- and intra-individual variability of diet, allowing us to reconstruct the diet of individual foxes on an average of 134 days. At the population level, over 70% of the diet was composed of rodents and chickens. Within the population, we found contrasting carbon isotopic signatures, indicating that some foxes preferentially consumed prey with high [delta]13C values, likely corresponding to Bresse chickens fed with maize, while others consumed wild food resources. We estimated that 4.4% (i.e. 3/68 foxes) of the fox population was composed of individuals that specialized in predating chicken. Chicken predation was higher in females than males and occurred more often in summer, when females were rearing kits. The availability of an easily catchable food resource could explain why some red foxes included chickens in their diet.

Bald Eagles depend on nearshore marine communities for most of their prey in this ecosystem, so we predicted that the recent decline in otter populations would have an indirect negative effect on diets and demography of Bald Eagles. Contrary to our predictions, we found no effects on density of breeding pairs on four islands from 1993[long dash]1994 to 2000[long dash]2002. In contrast, diets and diet diversity of Bald Eagles changed considerably between the two time periods, likely reflecting a change in prey availability resulting from the increase and subsequent decline in sea otter populations. The frequency of sea otter pups, rock greenling (Hexagammus lagocephalus), and smooth lumpsuckers (Aptocyclus ventricosus) in the eagle's diet declined with corresponding increases in Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus), Glaucous-winged Gulls (Larus glaucescens), Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius), and various species of seabirds during the period of the recent otter population decline. Breeding success and productivity of Bald Eagles also increased during this time period, which may be due to the higher nutritional quality of avian prey consumed in later years. Our results provide further evidence of the wide-ranging indirect effects of sea otter predation on nearshore marine communities and another apex predator, the Bald Eagle.

We installed 450 artificial nests (cup shaped) in each season and placed a Common quail (Coturnix coturnix) egg in each nest, totaling 900 nests. During the non-breeding season, our nests were the only ones present and thus the predator dilution effect should be absent. We estimated daily survival rate (DSR) using the ""Nest Survival"" function in the program MARK. We found a decrease in DSR at the middle and end in comparison with the onset of the non-breeding season, which supports the predator search image hypothesis. In comparison with the non-breeding season, we also found that DSR of artificial nests was lower at the onset and end of the breeding season, but higher in the middle of the breeding season. This pattern matched the higher availability of prey (i.e. natural nests) in the middle of the breeding season in the study site, supporting the dilution effect hypothesis. The survival rate of artificial nests suggests that both the search image and the dilution effect may occur during the breeding season, and that the predator dilution effect masks the predator search image in the middle of the breeding season. Our results expand our understanding regarding the effects of the search image and predator dilution effect hypotheses on nest predation, showing that both are density-dependent and may occur during the breeding season.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, many reintroductions fail to establish self-sustaining populations. The quality of the individuals released may crucially affect reintroduction success, but it is largely unknown which quality traits are important and how they might be improved, especially in captive-reared animals. We aimed at increasing survival of captive-bred grey partridges (Perdix perdix) after release. We experimentally tested the effects of prenatal and postnatal unpredictable food supply on post-release survival of two captive strains (two or >30 generations in captivity). 691 Full-grown birds representing all eight strain x prenatal x postnatal treatment combinations were released in autumn in 28 social groups (coveys) and followed in the field for six months by radio tracking and visual observations. Data were analysed with multistate capture-recapture models including several random effects. Post-release survival was higher in birds having encountered postnatal unpredictable food supply and decreased drastically with later release dates. Also, coveys strongly affected an individual's survival prospects. Our results suggest that post-release survival of captive-bred grey partridges can be increased significantly through simple, inexpensive pre-release measures in captivity, i.e. exposing them to an unpredictable environment. Similar measures might be successful in other species and could ultimately enhance reintroduction success. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Body size and body mass were significantly affected by the environmental parameters (i.e. SPG, NAO, ambient temperature and cloud cover) prevailing during the year of death. The effect of environmental conditions on body size was much stronger in the less productive region of eastern Iceland, apparently because in areas where food availability is meager, even a small difference in climate may tilt the balance from food sufficiency to food shortage. Western Iceland comprises only a quarter of the total surface area of the country, but its productive seashores are twice as long as those of all the rest of the country combined. It is interesting to note that the effect of the SPG, a marine phenomenon in the oceans surrounding Iceland, is reflected in the condition of the foxes more than the other climatic variables we used in this study, which are largely land-related. Because Arctic foxes in Iceland feed largely on marine birds and invertebrates, the SPG seems to encompass more accurate information regarding the direct ocean forces that affect food availability to the foxes.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Support was noted for the theory that female lynx are small because of their low total energy requirements and their ability to channel large amounts of excess energy into reproduction and the males are large as a result of sexual selection.

Year-round supplementary feeding is currently encouraged by major conservation charities in the UK as it is thought to be of benefit to bird conservation. However, little is understood about how the provision of supplementary food affects the behaviour and ecology of target and non-target species. Given the scale of supplementary feeding, any negative effects may have important implications for conservation. Potential nest predators are abundant in urban areas and some species frequently visit supplementary feeding stations. We assess whether providing supplementary food affects the likelihood of nest predation in the vicinity of the feeder, by acting as a point attractant for potential nest predators. We provided feeding stations (empty, peanut feeder, peanut feeder with guard to exclude potential nest predators) in an area of suburban parkland in the UK and monitored the predation rate of eggs placed in artificial nests located at distances that replicated the size of typical suburban gardens. Nest predators (Magpies Pica pica, Grey Squirrels Sciurus carolinensis) were frequent visitors to filled feeders, and predation caused by Magpies, European Jays Garrulus glandarius and Grey Squirrels was significantly higher when nests were adjacent to filled feeders. The presence of a feeder guard did not significantly reduce nest predation. As supplementary feeding is becoming increasingly common during the breeding season in suburban habitats, we suggest that providing point attractants to nest predators at this time may have previously unconsidered consequences for the breeding success of urban birds.",NA,,JME,No,,,No,predation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, this may not apply to all alternative prey groups in patchy landscapes. We investigated the demographic and aggregative numerical and functional responses of Common Buzzards Buteo buteo in relation to variations in prey abundance on a moor managed for Red Grouse Lagopus lagopus scotica in south-west Scotland over three consecutive breeding and non-breeding seasons. We predicted that predation of Red Grouse by Buzzards would increase when abundance of their preferred Field Vole Microtus agrestis prey declined. As vole abundance fluctuated, Buzzards responded functionally by eating voles in relation to their abundance, but they did not respond demographically in terms of either breeding success or density. During a vole crash year, Buzzards selected a wider range of prey typical of enclosed farmland habitats found on the moorland edge but fewer Grouse from the heather moorland. During a vole peak year, prey remains suggested a linear relationship between Grouse density and the number of Grouse eaten (a Type 1 functional response), which was not evident in either intermediate or vole crash years. Buzzard foraging intensity varied between years as vole abundance fluctuated, and foraging intensity declined with increasing heather cover. Our findings did not support the prediction that predation of Red Grouse would increase when vole abundance was low. Instead, they suggest that Buzzards predated Grouse incidentally while hunting for voles, which may increase when vole abundances are high through promoting foraging in heather moorland habitats where Grouse are more numerous. Our results suggest that declines in their main prey may not result in increased predation of all alternative prey groups when predators inhabit patchy landscapes.

A suggested cause is that foraging efficiency benefits accrue to diet specialists. This diet specificity hypothesis thus predicts that diet breadth and reproductive success should be inversely related within species. We highlight, however, that a prey availability hypothesis also makes the same prediction in some circumstances. Hence, when high diet specificity results from high encounter rates with an abundant, preferred prey, then prey availability may affect reproductive success, with diet specialization as an incidental correlate. Using three insular study areas in western Scotland, we examine diet specificity and reproductive success in Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos. Diet breadth and breeding productivity were not negatively related in any of our study areas, even though birds with specific diets did tend to have a higher incidence of preferred prey (grouse and lagomorphs) in the diet. Indeed, in two study areas there was evidence that diet generalists had higher breeding productivity. Our results therefore failed to support the diet specificity hypothesis but were consistent with the prey availability hypothesis. We highlight that although many other studies are superficially consistent with the diet specificity hypothesis, our study is not alone in failing to provide support and that the hypothesis does not provide a generic explanation for all relevant results. Diet specificity in predators can be at least partially a response to prey diversity, availability and distribution, and benefits associated with different prey types, so that being a generalist is not necessarily intrinsically disadvantageous. We suggest that the available evidence is more consistent with variation in prey abundance and availability as a more influential factor explaining spatial and temporal variation in breeding productivity of 'generalist' species such as the Golden Eagle. Under this argument, prey abundance and availability are the main drivers of variation in reproductive output. Diet specificity is a consequence of variation in prey availability, rather than a substantial cause of variation in reproductive success.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we explore the impact of each management factor on two key demographic response variables: chick survival rates and the number of breeding pairs. The numbers of linear metres of nesting strips had the most significantly positive effect on spring pairs, followed by the total number of supplementary food hoppers and the total hectares of brood-rearing and over-winter cover. Counterintuitively, encounters with Hen Harriers (Circus cyaneus) did not negatively affect chick survival or the number of spring pairs. While we cannot rule out the contribution of each explanatory variable, none had a statistically significant effect on chick survival, suggesting there may be locally confounding factors that our model could not capture. The weather conditions during the peak hatching period had a significant influence on chick survival, with the average maximum temperature observed in June having the strongest positive association with an increase of 1 [degree]C in the average maximum temperature in June associated with an increase in chick survival of 9.4% on average.

Using a 20-year-long time series of population densities for the five species and a dynamic model that has been previously parameterized for northeast Greenland, we analyzed the population and community level consequences of the ongoing and predicted climate change. Species' responses to climate change are complex, because in addition to the direct effects of climate change, which vary depending on species' life histories, species are also affected indirectly due to, e.g., predator[long dash]prey interactions. The lemming[long dash]predator community exemplifies these complications, yet a robust conclusion emerges from our modeling: in practically all likely scenarios of how climate change may influence the demography of the species, climate change increases the length of the lemming population cycle and decreases the maximum population densities. The latter change in particular is detrimental to the populations of the predators, which are adapted to make use of the years of the greatest prey abundance. Therefore, climate change will indirectly reduce the predators' reproductive success and population densities, and may ultimately lead to local extinction of some of the predator species. Based on these results, we conclude that the recent anomalous observations about lack of cyclic lemming dynamics in eastern Greenland may well be the first signs of a severe impact of climate change on the lemming[long dash]predator communities in Greenland and elsewhere in the high Arctic.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The study area is relatively flat with gently sloping fell-mountains covered by pine and birch forests, the highest tops reaching ca. 1,000 m above the sea level. Ptarmigan form almost 90% of the prey items during the breeding season, about three quarters of them being Willow Ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) and one quarter Rock Ptarmigan (L. muta). These two species offer almost the only available food for falcons during winter. The density of Willow Ptarmigan, the main prey species, has varied nine-fold during late winter and early spring from 2000 to 2010, and this fluctuation has had a marked effect on both the percentage of pairs starting to breed and on breeding success of the total population. Territory occupation varied markedly. Of the 25 territories surveyed every year from 2000 to 2010, 12 had breeding pairs every second year or more often, but one-quarter of them were occupied only once or twice during that study period.

In 2009-2010, when the density of Willow Ptarmigan population was exceptionally low, a nine fold decrease from the peak five years earlier, only one-tenth of the Gyrfalcon territories were occupied by breeding pairs. In mid-winter, 90% of the territories were occupied by falcons during the ptarmigan population high, but only one-half of them during the population low. Among 619 records of territory occupancy during the breeding season, all study years combined, pairs began nesting 214 times (34.6%). Of the nesting attempts, 36 (17%) appeared to fail during the egg-stage, but only four (2%) after hatching. Thus, 81% of the pairs that laid eggs were successful in raising at least one young. The number of young per brood varied from one to five, with 2.93 young per successful nesting, on average, and 1.34 young per occupied territory (the respective figures for the main study period 2000-2010, with almost all territories surveyed annually, were 2.98 and 1.40). The mean annual number of big young (probably fledged) per successful pair varied from 2.0 to 3.3 during the main study period, and that per occupied territory from 0.2 to 2.2., reflecting the population fluctuations of Willow Ptarmigan density. Breeding and non-breeding territorial adults tended to be faithful to their territories from year to year. Individual identification based on plumage characteristics and behavior suggested that adult females bred or occupied their territories for as long as eight years. The density of Gyrfalcon territories in my study area varied annually from ca. 1.7 to 2.7 per 1,000 km2 since the late 1990s. The total number of breeding pairs in Fennoscandia, including Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Kola Peninsula, Russia, has been estimated at ca. 600-1,200 pairs, twice as many as thought less than a decade ago, due to a marked increase in the Norwegian estimate. The current density of the Gyrfalcon population is probably at the same general level as 150 years ago. Earlier estimates of a long-term 80% decline are exaggerations due to methodological flaws, brief study periods, and surveys restricted to the classical sites. Those estimates did not take into account the facts that Gyrfalcon pairs do not breed every year and have alternative nests. An apparent population decline of ptarmigan and unintentional disturbance of breeding birds are the most critical threats to the Fennoscandian Gyrfalcon population.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Besides monitoring the fate of the chicks, we measured the abundance of microtine rodents and insect food and, together with weather records, we examined the observed mortality in relation to these factors. On average, 57% of the chicks died within the first month of life. Mortality was highest during the first 3 weeks, coinciding with the period when chicks feed almost exclusively on insects, depend heavily on their mother for maintaining body warmth, and cannot fly well. Predation was by far the most important proximate cause of mortality, accounting for 90% of all observed losses. Only 7% of the losses could be ascribed to direct effects of cold and wet weather, all recorded during the first 8 days of life. However, because predation losses were also quite high during and immediately after heavy rainfalls, adverse weather probably predisposed the chicks to mammalian predation. Most chicks were killed by mustelids, mainly pine martens; low numbers of red fox due to sarcoptic mange probably explains the low proportion taken by this predator. Among known predation losses (N = 40), goshawks accounted for a minimum of 25%. Chick mortality during the first month varied markedly (29%-83%) among the three years. It was highest in the year when June weather was exceptionally wet and cold; the same year when the density of microtine rodents and food abundance in terms of insect larvae were highest.

Using mathematical models, we considered the complex effect of both factors on the maintenance of genetic polymorphism in cyclically changing environments. We concentrated on asymmetric cyclic selection, which allows describing fluctuations of environments by analogy of food resources cycles with rare peaks and prolonged decline of prey abundance. The complex effect of maternal selection and overlapping generations turned out to work as follows: although overlapping generations always tend to dilate the polymorphism region, odd and even external cycles produce different types of polymorphism regions. Maternal selection under external odd cycles extends the coexistence region comparing with classic selection. Even cycles produce a part of parameter region, where the picture changes radically, and classic selection becomes more effective in maintaining polymorphism. Our models have clear biological interpretation, because we tried to model a situation demonstrated by natural populations of arctic foxes. The litter size being a major life history trait is a sex-limited female trait. It is influenced by maternal selection with cyclical fluctuations because of oscillations in food abundance. Arctic fox is a long-lived species having an age structure. The obtained results showed that compared with the simple Mendelian inheritance in the classic model, this trait inheritance allows polymorphism to be maintained in a wider range of the parameter that characterizes the advantage of survival in a small litter. Besides, adding overlapping generations to the model further broadens the parameter space for the protected polymorphism. Thus, this study shows that maternal selection and overlapping generations increases the chances of maintaining polymorphism in populations of arctic foxes. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

We compared two areas of moorland in Scotland: a dry heath with a low density of red grouse and poor chick survival; and a wetter heath/bog with relatively higher red grouse numbers and higher rates of chick survival. There were no differences in clutch size or the proportion of eggs hatching between the two moors but brood survival was significantly lower on the dry heath. Radio-tagged hens with broods were monitored during the first 12 days following hatching; the chicks were captured, weighed and faecal samples collected. Invertebrate samples were collected within brood feeding ranges. Analysis of chick faeces was used to identify dietary components. Heather comprised the major dietary component on both moors. Invertebrates formed a higher component of diet on the wet moor, and this was positively correlated with growth rates, which in turn were positively correlated with chick survival. We present data from an experiment carried out in 1982, in which chicks showed higher growth rates with increasing insect availability. We also show that broods in which all the chicks survived (4-10 days) had smaller home-range areas than broods in which some of the chicks died during this period. We suggest that the differences in chick survival between the two populations were the result of variations in the abundance of invertebrates, particularly tipulids.

Despite this, experiments that test the impact of ticks and tick-borne diseases on wild animal populations are rare. Here, we report on an experiment assessing the effect of ticks on red grouse productivity and chick growth in relation to other causes of poor recruitment at two sites in the Scottish uplands during 2005. Treated hens received two leg bands impregnated with the acaricide permethrin, while controls hens were untreated. Chicks were captured at c.2 weeks of age and fitted with a metal patagial tag, and chicks from treated hens also received a permethrin-impregnated strip. Mean tick burdens in treated chicks were close to zero compared with a mean of around 12 in the control group. Although treatment reduced tick infestations, it did not increase brood size. Growth rates in chicks from control and treated hens were similar during the first 10 days and comparable with chicks fed an ad-lib invertebrate-based diet. These results suggest that in this case, neither ticks (and the tick transmitted louping-ill virus) nor food shortages was the main cause of chick mortality. However, mortality in the adult hens was around 35 %, and predation accounted for 62 % of these losses before broods fledged. Our results indicate that on our study sites, predation may have a more important impact on grouse population dynamics than ticks and tick-borne disease. We suggest that it may be more cost effective to determine the causes of poor grouse population performance before implementing popular but expensive tick control measures such as the culling of alternative hosts and running acaracide treated sheep 'tick-mop' flocks.",NA,,JME,Phasianidae,No,,No,tick experiment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through a series of cafeteria trials, we investigated feeding preferences, consumption, and size selectivity in different sizes of Panulirus argus (Latreille, 1804). Our results demonstrate that small and large adult lobsters prefer different prey species. But unlike small lobsters that dominate in regions that are heavily fished, large lobsters are not restricted in the size of prey they can consume and they eat more prey than small lobsters.

One major reason for Grey Partridge population collapse in Europe is the decreased chick survival rate which directly reflects the abundance and biomass of invertebrates as essential chick food. We evaluated a new methodological design using human-imprinted Grey Partridge chicks as a biological assay to compare relative food availability (g / chick / 30 min) in five different habitat types in an arable landscape. On average, partridge chicks slightly lost weight during the trials in all considered arable habitat types, indicating a low invertebrate biomass but also indicating methodological limitations of our approach. The greatest weight loss was found in the conventional crops maize and wheat and on eutrophic grass tracks; the lowest in segetal vegetation patches within wheat fields and in wildflower crop cultivated as ecologically sound cosubstrate for biogas production. An increased defaecation rate due to the handling procedure is suggested to account for the weight loss so that invertebrate availability is discussed comparing the extent to which chicks could compensate this weight loss through food intake. Considering the discussed methodological restrictions in future studies, weight changes in human-imprinted Grey Partridge chicks provide a biologically relevant index of food availability and foraging value of farmland habitats and crops.

Such relationships were assessed using indices of predator performance (response vectors) for four predator species, together with independent ship-based acoustic estimates of abundance of their main prey, Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba), from South Georgia in the South Atlantic Ocean. Out of 32 response vectors investigated, 13 showed a significant non-linear relationship, based on a Holling Type II response, to krill abundance, and just five showed a significant linear relationship. Predator responses reflecting the processes during summer, when prey surveys were undertaken, showed the closest relationship with prey abundance. Distinct relationships existed between the variability of indices and the biological processes they measured. Body mass variables had the lowest variability (CVs 10%), whereas those measuring breeding success showed the greatest variability (CVs > 50%). Multivariate indices, produced by combining response vectors from all four predator species into a single combined index, provided a better fit with krill data than any of the individual vectors. Whereas population size parameters for individual species showed no relationship with annual estimates of krill abundance, a combined, multispecies population size index did show a significant response. Understanding the form of the relationship between concurrent indicators of prey abundance and key ecosystem metrics/reference points, such as population size, is crucial to the application of monitoring data to management action.

Because chick and brood survival are directly linked to annual recruitment and may be the primary factors that limit sage-grouse population growth, we estimated 28-day survival rates of radiomarked chicks and broods from 2000 to 2003. We examined relationships between survival and several habitat variables measured at brood sites, including food availability (insects and forbs); horizontal cover of sagebrush, grasses, and forbs; and vertical cover of sagebrush and grass. We monitored 506 radiomarked chicks from 94 broods; chick survival was 0.392 (SE = 0.024). We found evidence that both food and cover variables were positively associated with chick survival, including Lepidoptera availability, slender phlox (Phlox gracilis) frequency, total forb cover, and grass cover. The effect of total grass cover on chick survival was dependent on the proportion of short grass. The hazard of an individual chick's death decreased 8.6% (95% CI = -1.0 to 18.3) for each percentage point increase in total grass cover when the proportion of short grass was >70%. Survival of 83 radiomarked broods was 0.673 (SE = 0.055). Lepidoptera availability and slender phlox frequency were the only habitat variables related to brood survival. Risk of total brood loss decreased by 11.8% (95% CI = 1.2-22.5) for each additional Lepidoptera individual and 2.7% (95% CI = 20.4 to 5.8) for each percentage point increase in the frequency of slender phlox found at brood sites. Model selection results revealed that temporal differences in brood survival were associated with variation in the availability of Lepidoptera and slender phlox. Years with high brood survival corresponded with years of high Lepidoptera availability and high slender phlox frequency. These foods likely provided high-quality nutrition for chicks during early growth and development and enhanced survival. Habitat management that promotes Lepidoptera and slender phlox abundance during May and June (i.e., early brood rearing) should have a positive effect on chick and brood survival in the short term and potentially increase annual recruitment.

Various forest management practices have been used to stimulate understory development within upland hardwoods, but evaluation of such practices on cover and food resources for wild turkey broods is incomplete. Therefore, we compared effects of 7 silvicultural treatments (repeated fire, shelterwood harvest, shelterwood harvest with one fire, retention cut, retention cut with repeated fire, retention cut with herbicide, and retention cut with herbicide and repeated fire) on cover and food resources for wild turkey broods in mature upland hardwoods of the Ridge and Valley Physiographic Province, Tennessee, USA, during 2000-2009. Canopy reduction treatments enhanced understory conditions for wild turkey broods. Eight years following initial treatment, light infiltration in retention cuts with repeated fire was 6 times greater than that within control, 5 times greater than that within shelterwood harvests, and twice that within shelterwood harvests with one prescribed fire. Woody species dominated understory composition following all treatments and controls. Understory disturbance (prescribed fire and broadcast herbicide treatments) reduced density of stems >1.4 m tall and <11.4 cm diameter at breast height (dbh) and created less visual obstruction above 1 m compared with canopy reduction treatments without understory disturbance. Following canopy reduction without repeated prescribed fire, woody vegetation exceeded ideal height for wild turkey broods after 3 growing seasons and light infiltration returned to control levels within 7 years. Soft mast production was greatest following treatments that included canopy reduction, but varied by year and site. Invertebrate biomass did not increase following any treatment, but all treatment areas contained enough invertebrates to meet the protein requirement for a wild turkey brood (10.1 poults) for 28 days on <30 ha. Where wild turkey is a focal species and understory structure inmature upland hardwoods is limiting for broods, we recommend reducing canopy coverage to 60-70% and using low-intensity fire every 3-5 years to enhance and maintain brood cover and increase food availability.

In the present study, animal-borne video, GPS, accelerometer and dive behaviour data loggers were used to investigate the fine-scale foraging behaviour of Macaroni penguins (Eudyptes chrysolophus) in response to prey type, patch density and temporal variation in diving behaviour. Individuals mainly dived during the day and utilised two strategies, targeting different prey types. Subantarctic krill (Euphausia vallentini) were consumed during deep dives, while small soft-bodied fish were captured on shallow dives or during the ascent phase of deep dives. Despite breeding in large colonies individuals seemed to be solitary foragers and did not engage with conspecifics in coordinated behaviour as seen in other group foraging penguin species. This potentially reflects the high abundance and low manoeuvrability of krill. Video data were used to validate prey capture signals in accelerometer data and a Support Vector Machine learning algorithm was developed to identify prey captures that occurred throughout the entire foraging trip. Prey capture rates indicated that Macaroni penguins continued to forage beyond the optimal give up time. However, bout-scale analysis revealed individuals terminated diving behaviour for reasons other than patch quality.

The birdlife of Northeast Greenland is to a high extent dominated by five wader species, the Common Ringed Plover Charadrius hiaticula, Red Knot Calidris canutus, Sanderling C. alba, Dunlin C. alpina and Ruddy Turnstone Arenaria interpres, but Long-tailed Skua Stercorarius longicaudus and Snow Bunting Plectrophenax nivalis are also common. A few species of divers, geese, ducks and other pas- serines are also found together with highly varying numbers of the Rock Ptarmigan Lagopus mutus and Snowy Owl Nyctea scandiaca. The climate of High Arctic Greenland is continental, so few instances of severe or inclement weather have occurred during our study years. Early season food availability appears to be the most important factor governing timing of egg-laying in waders, but spring snow-cover takes over, when the snow-cover exceeds a certain threshold. However, regional differences in spring snow-cover are more pronounced than annual variability, with the result that waders rarely fail on population level. We did not find pronounced effects of spring snow-cover and temperature on breeding performance of other species, but our data are very limited for several of these. As expected, we found pronounced effects of lemming abundance on breeding success of the Long-tailed Skua, Snowy Owl and King Eider Somateria spectabilis. Yet, so far we have not seen the same strong effect of predation on waders' eggs and young in relation to lemming abundance as is typical especially in the Siberian Arctic. The reason may be that lemmings never reach the same high densities in High Arctic Greenland as they do in Eurasia, where in addition to Collared Lemmings Dicrostonyx spp., communities also include Lemmus and vole, Microtus spp. and Clethrionomys spp., species and where Arctic Foxes Alopex lagopus may also occur in higher numbers than in Greenland.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Control of mid-sized mammalian nest predators (i.e., meso-mammals) is often conducted to increase reproductive success on lands managed for bobwhites. Nest predation by meso-mammals, however, is only one part of a complex predator-prey trophic system. There is limited understanding of the effect of nest predators on bobwhite demographics, which creates uncertainty about the efficacy of nest predator control. We quantified demographic effects on bobwhite populations from reducing meso-mammals on 4 study areas managed for bobwhites in northern Florida and southwestern Georgia, USA, during 2000-2006. After 1 year of pre-treatment monitoring (2000), we reduced meso-mammal nest predator abundance through trapping over 3-year intervals, March to September, on 2 sites using a crossover design. Efficacy of trapping was demonstrated by a 43% reduction in scent station visitation rates of meso-mammals. Meso-mammal control increased all demographic metrics including a 30% increase in nesting propensity, a 10% increase in nest success, and a 43% increase in chicks produced. Despite significant regional variation in breeding season survival rates, this equated to an average 18% increase in autumn density on trapped sites. Decision-makers should weigh the tradeoffs between bobwhite population goals and costs of meso-mammal control, where those that value maximum bobwhite density and reduced annual variation should likely implement control of meso-mammals.

Hens with access to supplemental feed produced 0.86 and 1.60 nest per hen while hens on control sites produced 0.15 and 0.81 nest per hen during the 2011 and 2012 nesting season, respectively. Average nest initiation varied slightly between treatment and control; though, average nesting season length was 16 and 31 days longer on treatment units. This benefit indicates females with access to food supplementation were in better physical condition compared to females on control units. However, nest success ([beta]=-0.03, SE=0.40), clutch size (t=-0.37, p=0.70), and average intra-clutch egg volumes (([beta]=-0.06, SE=0.20) (t=0.50, p=0.61) were unaffected by food supplementation. Total net productivity estimates showed more chicks per hen were produced on treatment sites (P=2.34, SE=0.04 (2011); P=5.75, SE=0.12 (2012)1 than control units (P=0.61, SE=0.001 (2011); P=3.47, SE=0.13 (2012)). Our results suggest that bobwhites with access to supplemental feed broadcast into roadside vegetation throughout the breeding season can potentially increase nesting attempts which may result in increased production and offset population fluctuations due to drought conditions.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Both stressors were considered in our experiment in the simazine exposure and food availability to lizards (Eremias argus). The results revealed that starvation significantly reduced the lizard's energy reserve and native immune function, while the accumulation of simazine in the liver was significantly increased. Simazine caused oxidative stress in the liver of lizards, but oxidative damage only occurred in the starved lizards. Simazine also changed the energy reserves, native immune function and detoxification of well-fed lizards, while the starved lizards showed different sensitivity to simazine. Simazine or starvation treatment independently activated the lizard HPA axis, but co-treatment caused the HPA axis inhibition. Besides, according to the variations on amino acid neurotransmitters, corticosterone hormone and thermoregulatory behavior, we inferred that lizards in threatens take the appropriate strategy on energy investment and allocation through neural, endocrine and behavioral pathways to maximize benefits in dilemma. Energy allocation was necessary, while suppression on any physiological process comes at a cost that is detrimental to long-term individual fitness. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

To examine spatial and temporal variation in productivity, we estimated breeding parameters at 5 sites in Alaska: at Cape Espenberg and the Copper River Delta we estimated nest survival, and at 3 sites within the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta we estimated nest survival and productivity. Nest survival varied broadly among sites and years; annual estimates (lower, upper 95% confidence interval) ranged from 0.09 (0.03, 0.29) at Cape Espenberg in 2001 to 0.93 (0.76, 0.99) at the Copper River Delta in 2002. Annual variation among sites was not concordant, suggesting that site-scale factors had a strong influence on nest survival. Models of nest survival indicated that visits to monitor nests had a negative effect on nest daily survival probability, which if not accounted for biased nest survival strongly downward. The sensitivity of breeding Red-throated Loons to nest monitoring suggests other sources of disturbance that cause incubating birds to flush from their nests may also reduce nest survival. Nest daily survival probability at the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta was negatively associated with an annual index of fox occurrence. Survival through the incubation and chick-rearing periods on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta ranged from 0.09 (0.001, 0.493) to 0.50 (0.04, 0.77). Daily survival probability during the chick-rearing period was lower for chicks that had a sibling in 2 of 3 years, consistent with the hypothesis that food availability was limited. Estimates of annual productivity on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta ranged from 0.17 to 1.0 chicks per pair. Productivity was not sufficient to maintain population stability in 2 of 3 years, indicating that nest depredation by foxes and poor foraging conditions during chick rearing can have important effects on productivity.

A total of 168 (15-week old) laying quails (Coturnix coturnix Japonica) were divided into 6 experimental groups (with similar initial average body weight).

The results showed that adding 100 mg/kg of Pb to basal diet was adversely affected the performance parameters and, feed intake and egg production were significantly decreased by Pb supplementation (P 0.01). However, the EA supplementation to Pb groups improved the performance parameters. Compared with the Pb alone group, in Pb + EA-500 group increased egg production by 8.4%. There were no significant differences in the Haugh unit, albumen index, and yolk index among groups (P 0.05).

The protein levels of caspase-3 and-9 were significantly increased in the Pb group compared to the control group, whereas EA supplementation alleviated the Pb-induced apoptosis by decreasing caspase-3 and-9 levels in the liver tissue (p < 0.001). In laying quails exposed to Pb toxicity, EA supplementation improves the performance parameters, enhances the antioxidant defense system, and suppresses apoptosis via regulates the expression of caspase-3 and-9.

Existing knowledge of the causes of decline and the effectiveness of conservation measures was reviewed. Population studies from the UK indicated three periods: a stable population before 1950, sharply decreasing numbers in 1950-1970 and a continued decline after 1970. Other European studies fitted into this picture, with a 10-year lag in each period. The onset of population decrease corresponded with a sharp decrease in chick survival mainly caused by reduced insect availability due to pesticide use. Several factors caused the continued decreasing numbers after 1970, such as decreased hatching success and an increased role of predation. Measures to restore partridge numbers should firstly focus on the main cause of population decline, that is, improve foraging conditions to increase chick survival rate. Next to creation of special partridge habitat, conventional agriculture offers good opportunities to improve foraging conditions.

The study of mesopredator interactions is a growing area of research in tropical forests and shedding new light on inter-guild competition between threatened vertebrate species that were previously little understood. Here, we investigate sympatry between the Sunda clouded leopard (Neofelis diardi) and Asiatic golden cat (Pardofelis temminckii) living in the Sumatran rainforests of Indonesia. We investigate: i) spatial overlap of predator-prey species using a combination of single-species occupancy modelling and Bayesian two-species modelling, while controlling for the possible influence of several confounding landscape variables; and, ii) temporal overlap between mesopredators and their shared prey through calculating their kernel density estimate associations. From four study areas, representing lowland, hill, sub-montane and montane forest, 28,404 camera trap nights were sampled. Clouded leopard and golden cat were respectively detected in 24.3% and 22.6% of the 292 sampling sites (camera stations) and co-occurred in 29.6% of the sites where they were detected. Golden cat occupancy was highest in the study area where clouded leopard occupancy was lowest and conversely lowest in the study area where clouded leopard occupancy was highest. However, our fine-scale (camera trap site) analyses found no evidence of avoidance between these two felid species. While both mesopredators exhibited highest spatial overlap with the larger-bodied prey species, temporal niche separation was also found. Clouded leopard was more nocturnal and, consequently, had higher temporal overlap with the more nocturnal prey species, such as porcupine and mouse deer, whereas the more diurnal golden cat had higher overlap with the strictly diurnal great argus pheasant.

Predator genotypes with different reproductive potential are unequally adapted to food resource limitation; therefore, the fitness of a predator's genotype is determined by not only its own genotype but also the prey numbers. We use discrete-time equations for modeling, which allows considering features of the community species lifecycle. The paper extends our previous studies modeling evolution of a local population to explain existing genetic diversity by litter size in various (natural and farmed) populations of Arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus). Direct inclusion of prey population dynamics in the model of community allows analyzing polymorphism maintenance in arctic fox populations under more realistic conditions. As in simpler models, the direction of evolution of the predator population is shown to be generally determined by the relative position of its genotype fitnesses, whereas the parameter set characterizing birth rates of the prey and the predator, as well as the characteristics of interspecific interaction, determines the dynamic mode of interacting species numbers. However, even without overdominance, a predator can maintain a stable polymorphism owing to large-amplitude fluctuations in the number of prey, which change the direction of natural selection in the predator population. Different dynamics in the genetic composition of the predator can lead to a change in the dynamic mode of the prey numbers.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To investigate the effects of predators on the behavior of prey fish and to test whether the possible effects varied with predator size, black carp (Mylopharyngodon piceus) and snakehead (Channa argus) (a size-matched predator treatment with a similar body size to prey fish and a larger predator treatment with approximately 2.7 times of the body mass of prey fish) were selected to function as prey and predator, respectively. Their spontaneous activities were videorecorded in a central circular arena surrounded by a ring holding the stimulus fish. The distance between prey and predator fish was approximately 200% of the distance between two prey fish, which suggested that black carp can distinguish their conspecifics from heterospecifics and probably recognize the snakehead as a potential predator. The prey fish spent substantially less time moving and exhibited an overall shorter total distance of movement after the size-matched or large predator was introduced, which possibly occurred due to increased vigilance or efforts to reduce the possibility of detection by potential predators. However, there was no significant difference in either distance or spontaneous activities between two predator treatments. These findings suggested that (1) an anti-predator strategy in black carp might involve maintaining a safe distance, decreasing activity and possibly increased vigilance and that (2) the behaviors of prey response to predators were not influenced by their relative size difference.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And understanding the specific local-scale drivers of clutch size diversity within species can provide insight into the local adaptation of species or the evolution of key life history traits. Here, we collected clutch size data of a wide-ranging female lizard (Eremias argus) from field observation and literature across populations of varying elevations and latitudes in China. We then used mixedeffects models to test the relationship between clutch size, body size, habitat type, elevation, latitudes, and climate conditions. Unsurprisingly, body size was positively correlated with clutch size variations across all populations. When we accounted for body size, females from populations at higher latitudes had larger clutches, while females in less variable rainfall environments had smaller clutches. Interestingly, we found that females occupying higher geographic gradients (e.g., latitude and elevation) with certain habitats (e.g., grasslands and farmlands) were associated with larger clutch sizes. Thus, our study shows support for similar global macroecological drivers of clutch size diversity among lizard species, and also suggests that female ectotherms might have different reproductive decisions employed in response to local climates to maximise population replacement.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We found that individuals nesting in a stratum that experienced higher levels of predation by arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus) were 3 times more likely to move to the other stratum than vice versa, despite slightly higher risk of tidal flooding in the second stratum. These results suggest that Black Brant changed nest locations in an attempt to maximize reproductive fitness and they are consistent with a long-term shift in nest density over the course of the study.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study investigates whether proximity to human settlement affects predator abundance, predation risk, and shorebird daily nest survival near Churchill by measuring these variables at varying distances from town during two nesting seasons. Active fox dens decreased in number close to town; however, there was no clear trend in avian predator abundance in relation to town. Predation risk on artificial nests decreased as distances from active fox dens and Parasitic Jaeger (Stercorarius parasiticus) nests increased, decreased with proximity to town, and decreased with a camera present. Shorebird daily nest survival tended to be lower near jaeger nests and there was some support for a positive effect of camera presence and proximity to town. Overall, these results suggest that shorebird nest survival in the sub-Arctic can be heavily impacted by proximity to nests of avian predators, but that shorebirds may benefit from proximity to town likely due to reduced fox denning activity.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Galliformes: Odontophoridae), population declines are well documented, but pinpointing the reasons for these decreases has proven elusive. Bobwhite population declines are attributed primarily to loss of habitat and land use changes. This, however, does not entirely explain population declines in areas intensively managed for bobwhites. Although previous research demonstrates the negative impact of red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta Buren) (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) on northern bobwhites, the mechanisms underlying this effect are largely unknown. To meet the protein demands of early growth and development, bobwhite chicks predominantly consume small insects, of which ants are a substantial proportion. Fire ants alter ant community dynamics by often reducing native ant diversity and abundance while concurrently increasing the abundance of individuals. Fire ants have negative effects on chicks, but they are also a large potential protein source, making it difficult to disentangle their net effect on bobwhite chicks. To help investigate these effects, we conducted a laboratory experiment to understand (1) whether or not bobwhites consume fire ants, and (2) how the benefits of this consumption compare to the deleterious impacts of bobwhite chick exposure to fire ants. Sixty bobwhite chicks were separated into two groups of 30; one group was provided with starter feed only and the second group was provided with feed and fire ants. Bobwhite chicks were observed feeding on fire ants. Chicks that fed on fire ants had reduced survival and weight gain. Our results show that, while fire ants increase potential food sources for northern bobwhite, their net effect on bobwhite chicks is deleterious.

We documented the behavioural responses and breeding investment of macaroni penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus across five breeding seasons where local prey density changed by five-fold; from very low to highly abundant. When prey availability was low, foraging trips were significantly longer and extended overnight. Birds also foraged farther from the colony, potentially in order to reach more distant foraging grounds and allow for increased search times. These extended foraging trips were also linked to a marked decrease in fledgling weights, most likely associated with reduced rates of provisioning. Furthermore, by comparing our results with previous work on this population, it appears that lowered first-year survival rates associated, at least partially, with fledging masses were also evident for this cohort.

Four small game species within this size range - brown hare Lepus europaeus, pheasant Phasianus cotchicus, grey partridge Perdix perdix, and redleg partridge Alectoris rufa-were also censussed twice a year throughout the study. Fox diet was determined by analysis of faecal material, with diet of cubs at breeding dens analysed separately. Two-thirds of fox diet consisted of vertebrate prey in the range 0.3-3.0 kg. Prey types of overwhelming importance for foxes in other environments - such as small rodents, fruit and invertebrates - each contributed 10% or less to fox diet. Fox territory size was determined by radio-tracking eight adult foxes during a three-year period in spring, summer and autumn. Details of family group size, number of litters per group, and litter size were determined through field observation. Adjacent fox territories (mean size 2.7 km-2) formed a contiguous mosaic with individual foxes spending less than 10% of their active time on ground shared with neighbouring groups. Typically each territorial group held an adult pair and had one litter of four cubs. Half of these groups had an additional, non-breeding vixen. Most known fox deaths were the result of deliberate control by man. Control on a central 4.75 km-2 farm reduced adult fox density and eliminated cub production there, and for the whole 11 km-2 study site deliberate control was almost sufficient in itself to negate annual numerical increase in fox numbers. The food requirements of foxes living at this density was estimated, and from this the biomass of lagomorphs and gamebirds consumed. Even assuming early dispersal of juvenile foxes, the biomass of these species consumed annually was substantial relative to that available at the onset of breeding.",10.2981/wlb.1995.0016,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Variations in egg production were significantly related to hen food intake and weight loss during laying but not to food intake or weight gained in the five weeks before laying. This supports the Thomas (1988) hypothesis that grouse produce eggs from 'income' rather than 'capital' reserves. There were no significant differences in the total weight, number or rate of eggs produced by hens from different treatment groups. However, hens infected with worms developing at the onset of laying lost significantly more weight while laying and, at the end of egg laying, were 13% lighter than other birds. In wild birds this could affect the quality of incubation and maternal care of chicks.

In black-legged kittiwakes and Brunnich's guillemots, whose predators were generalists, breeding was less synchronous and there was no fitness advantage in hatching close to the mean.

A number of hypotheses predict sexual segregation but these are often contradictory with no agreement as to a common cause, perhaps because they are species specific. We explicitly tested three of these hypotheses which are commonly linked by a dependence on sexual dimorphism for animals which exhibit fine-scale sexual segregation; the Predation Risk Hypothesis, the Forage Selection Hypothesis, and the Activity Budget Hypothesis, in a single system the pheasant, Phasianus colchicus; a large, sedentary bird that is predominantly terrestrial and therefore analogous to ungulates rather than many avian species which sexually segregate. Over four years we reared 2,400 individually tagged pheasants from one day old and after a period of 8-10 weeks we released them into the wild. We then followed the birds for 7 months, during the period that they sexually segregate, determined their fate and collected behavioural and morphological measures pertinent to the hypotheses. Pheasants are sexually dimorphic during the entire period that they sexually segregate in the wild; males are larger than females in both body size and gut measurements. However, this did not influence predation risk and predation rates (as predicted by the Predation Risk Hypothesis), diet choice (as predicted by the Forage Selection Hypothesis), or the amount of time spent foraging, resting or walking (as predicted by the Activity Budget Hypothesis). We conclude that adult sexual size dimorphism is not responsible for sexual segregation in the pheasant in the wild. Instead, we consider that segregation may be mediated by other, perhaps social, factors. We highlight the importance of studies on a wide range of taxa to help further the knowledge of sexual segregation.",NA,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although insufficient to prove coexistence, trait comparisons provide a first step to identify functional differences between co-occurring congeneric species in relation to mechanisms of coexistence. Here, a comparative review on life history and ecological traits is presented for two pairs of co-occurring species of spiny lobsters in the genus Panulirus: P. gracilis and P. inflatus from the Eastern Central Pacific region, and P. argus and P. guttatus from the Caribbean region. Panulirus gracilis and P. inflatus have similar larval, postlarval, and adult sizes and a similar diet, but differ in degree of habitat specialization, fecundity, and growth rate. However, little is known on behavioral traits of these two species that may influence their competitive abilities and susceptibility to predators. The more abundant information on P. argus and P. guttatus shows that these two species differ more broadly in degree of habitat specialization, larval, postlarval and adult sizes, diet, fecundity, growth rate, degree of sociality, defense mechanisms, susceptibility to predators, and chemical ecology, suggesting a greater degree of niche differentiation between P. argus and P. guttatus than between P. gracilis and P. inflatus. Whether the substantial niche differentiation and apparent interspecific trade-offs between P. argus and P. guttatus relative to P. gracilis and P. inflatus reflect an earlier divergence of the former pair of species in the evolution of the genus constitutes an intriguing hypothesis.

We also studied the effect of weather on grouse reproduction. We found that buzzard predation alone did not support APH, but did so when combined with goshawk predation. Kill rate by goshawks showed a linear response for black grouse chicks but was not density dependent. It, however, explained the losses of chicks but not their autumn density. Combined density of chicks with adults correlated with vole index in the latter study period (since 1994), thus, giving some support for APH.

Using a combination of concurrent at-sea (predator observations, net hauls and multi-frequency acoustics), and land-based (animal tracking and diet analysis) techniques, we examined variability in the foraging ecology of these sympatric top predators during the austral summer and autumn of 2004. Krill availability derived from acoustic surveys was low during summer, increasing in autumn. During the breeding season, krill occurred in 80% of fur seal diet samples, with fish remains in 37% of samples. Penguin diets contained the highest proportion of fish in over 20 years of routine monitoring (46% by mass; particularly the myctophid Electrona antarctica), with krill (33%) and amphipods (Themisto gaudichaudii; 21%) also occurring. When constrained by the need to return and feed their offspring both predator species foraged to the northwest of South Georgia, consistent with an area of high macrozooplankton biomass, but fur seals were apparently more successful at exploiting krill. When unconstrained by chick-rearing (during March) penguins foraged close to the Shag Rocks shelf-break, probably exploiting the high daytime biomass of fish in this area. Penguins and seals are able to respond differently to periods of reduced krill abundance (in terms of variability in diet and foraging behaviour), without detriment to the breeding success of either species.

Fipronil-treated seed ingestion might threaten granivorous farmland birds, in particular, Gallinaceous birds that are particularly sensitive to this insecticide. We report here on exposure risk and effects in a game bird of high socioeconomic importance, the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa). We fed captive birds with untreated maize (controls) or with a mixture of untreated treated maize (ratio 80:20; exposed birds) during 10 days at the beginning of the breeding period (n = 12 pairs in each group). We first show that exposed partridges did not reject treated seeds but reduced food intake and lost body condition. We further studied the effects of treated seed ingestion on adult survival, oxidative balance, plasma biochemistry, carotenoid-based coloration, cellular immune response, steroid hormone levels, and reproduction. Fipronil exposure altered blood biochemistry and sexual hormone levels and reduced cellular immune response, antioxidant levels, and carotenoid-based coloration. Exposed pairs also had reduced egg fecundation rate and produced eggs with fewer antioxidants and offspring that had reduced cellular immune response. These negative effects on adult partridges, their reproductive performance, and offspring quality highlight that fipronil-treated seed ingestion is a significant threat to wild birds.",NA,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alterations of these pathways could be especially intense in ecosystems characterized by a simple trophic structure and rapid warming trends, such as in the Arctic. However, quantifying the multiple direct and indirect pathways through which climate change is likely to alter trophic interactions and their relative strength remains a challenge. Here, we aim to identify direct and indirect causal mechanisms driven by climate affecting predator-prey interactions of species sharing a tundra food web. We based our study on relationships between one Arctic predator (Arctic fox) and its two main prey - lemmings (preferred prey) and snow geese (alternate prey) - which are exposed to variable local and regional climatic factors across years. We used a combination of models mapping multiple causal links among key variables derived from a long-term dataset (21 years). We obtained several possible scenarios linking regional climate factors (Arctic oscillations) and local temperature and precipitation to the breeding of species. Our results suggest that both regional and local climate factors have direct and indirect impacts on the breeding of foxes and geese. Local climate showed a positive causal link with goose nesting success, while both regional and local climate displayed contrasted effects on the proportion of fox breeding. We found no impact of climate on lemming abundance. We observed positive relationships between lemming, fox and goose reproduction highlighting numerical and functional responses of fox to the variability of lemming abundance. Our study measures causal links and strength of interactions in a food web, quantifying both numerical response of a predator and apparent interactions between its two main prey. These results improve our understanding of the complex effects of climate on predator-prey interactions and our capacity to anticipate food web response to ongoing climate change.

High requirements for protein in the diet of bobwhites for reproduction and growth and the low quality of protein in many cereal grains led us to hypothesize that dietary limitations in certain essential amino acids may occur in wild bobwhite populations in western Oklahoma. We exposed this hypothesis by examining seasonal changes in the amino acid composition of bobwhite diets and comparing observed levels in their diets to known requirements of a closely related species, Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica). Bobwhites were harvested seasonally (summer, autumn, winter 1989-1990) on three ranches from supplementally fed ( lt 250 m from a food plot or feeder) and reference populations ( gt 900 m from supplemental food). Bobwhites used supplemental food for gt 15% of their diet in only 1 of 6 seasons. Supplemental food did not appreciably influence the diets of bobwhites, as evidenced by significant differences in concentrations of fat and essential amino acids in crop digesta. Although crude protein requirements apparently were met in all seasons, levels of gtoreq one essential amino acid in diets of reference and supplemented bobwhites were below recommended levels for growth or breeding in Japanese quail. The sulfur-containing amino acids, methionine + cystine, were consistently the most limiting nutrients in the diet, with seasonal means ranging from 0-53% below the recommended levels for growth or breeding in Japanese quail. These observations support our hypothesis that selected essential amino acids may be seasonally limiting in diets of bobwhites. Dietary requirements of bobwhite for suspected limiting amino acids should be determined in feeding trials to identify more accurately the magnitude of these apparent deficiencies.",10.2307/2426205,,JME,No,,,No,Odontophoridae; supplemental feeding,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Small rodent density was measured by snap trapping during spring and autumn. Losses varied as predicted by the classical alternative prey hypothesis (Hagen 1952 and Lack 1954, as elaborated by Angelstam et al. 1984); high losses during rodent crash years (85.5% capercaillie, 51% black grouse), and smaller losses during peak years (54.5% capercaillie, 32.5% black grouse). Losses were inversely related to autumn abundance of rodents in capercaillie (P < 0.05), but the correlation was not significant for black grouse (0.10 < P < 0.20). In capercaillie, the only species with an adequate sample for analysis, no relationship was detected between spring density of rodents and nest loss. Losses during the prepeak years were nearly as high as during crash years, a result inconsistent wiht the model.

Here, we investigated the diet and breeding biology of buzzards as well as abundance of their possible prey during 5 years in the low-Arctic shrub tundra on the Nenetsky Ridge, Russia. We employed three complementary methods to assess the diet of this Arctic predator-pellet dissection, identification of prey remains on nests, and stable isotope analysis-to overcome their respective limitations. We documented fluctuations in abundances of the likely prey, namely rodents, ptarmigans, and hares. Nesting density of buzzards changed substantially over the years, but did not track the abundance cycle of the rodents. The number of buzzard fledglings was relatively low (1.08 [plus or minus]A 0.3) and did not change according to the density of rodents. In the year when rodents were at their lowest abundance, diet analyses of nestlings documented a shift from rodents to alternative prey, with a decrease in the proportion of tundra voles and an increase in proportion of hares, ptarmigans, and ducks. Here, we argue that buzzards may adopt different feeding strategies along the gradient from generalists to specialists.

The hazel grouse [Bonasa bonasia] was clearly the most numerous tetraonid species in the study area of 500 km2, accounting for 74% of all tetraonid records. During its population lows the hazel grouse mainly occurred in its optimal habitats. The habitat amplitude was positively correlated with the abundance of the species, and during the increasing phase suboptimal habitats were filled at a faster rate than optimal habitats. The habitat distribution pattern may act to stabilize predation. At the beginning of the study period, in 1974, the number of breeding goshawk pairs was 25. In 1976-1977 the tetraonids had an exceptionally deep population low and in consequence the goshawk population crashed to the level of about 10 breeding pairs. There were no marked changes in the mean brood size of the goshawk during the study period 1974-1981. The hazel grouse is the most important single prey species of the goshawk. The percentage of hazel grouse biomass in the diet during the breeding season varied in 1974-1981 between 4 and 34%. The proportion of tetraonids in the diet decreases strongly in the course of the summer, especially when the young of corvids fledge. The goshawk showed no clear numerical response to fluctuations in hazel grouse densities. There was a marked functional response, but the form of the response curve was atypically concave. The shape of the curve would actually be sigmoid (Holling's type 3) if the data had included higher densities of hazel grouse. The shape of the functional response curve depends on the prey density and on the prey utilization rate of the predator, and most types of response curves may be derived from the S-shaped sigmoid curve.

We used over 70,000 greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) wings, derived from hunter harvest in three western states, to characterize spatiotemporal variation in sage-grouse productivity throughout the North American Great Basin during 1993 - 2020. We then tested the hypothesis that previously-identified associations between precipitation and sage-grouse productivity are mediated by the availability of mesic habitats, which provide the diet resources required by broods during typical late-summer seasonal drought. We used random forest regression to model sage-grouse productivity as a function of mesic habitat availability (defined as those areas with maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) >=0.3) during the late brood-rearing period, the more general effect of annual precipitation, and landcover composition. We also evaluated potential acute direct effects of exposure to inclement weather on sage-grouse productivity. Finally, we examined which weather and topographic variables best predict mesic habitat availability. We found the predicted positive relationship between mesic habitat availability and sage-grouse productivity, but annual precipitation explained additional variation in productivity even after accounting for mesic habitat availability. Hence, precipitation and drought may drive sage-grouse productivity via more than one mechanism acting on multiple demographic rates. Productivity was also limited by exotic annual grass invasion and conifer encroachment. Mesic habitat availability was a function of topographic relief, mean elevation, annual mean snow water equivalent, and winter temperatures, indicating that snowpack recharges the late summer mesic resources that support sage-grouse productivity. Management actions focused on maintaining and restoring mesic re-sources and drought resilient habitats, limiting the spread of exotic annual grasses, and reversing conifer encroachment should support future sage-grouse recruitment and help mitigate the effects of climate change.",NA,,JME,Phasianidae,,,No,climate/weather experiment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Greater Sage-Grouse are susceptible to predation from egg to adult, leading to the hypothesis that predator control would be an effective conservation tool for sage-grouse populations. Therefore, I reviewed the literature pertaining to predator communities across the range of Greater Sage-Grouse and assessed the effects of predation on sage-grouse life history. I then provided a framework for evaluating when predator management may be warranted. Generally, nest-success rates and adult survival are high, suggesting that on average predation is not limiting. However, in fragmented landscapes or in areas with subsidized predator populations, predation may limit population growth. Few studies linked habitat quality to mortality rates, and fewer still linked these rates to predation. Predator management studies have not provided sufficient evidence to support implementation over broad geographic or temporal scales, but limited information suggests predator management may provide short-term relief for a population sink. Evaluating the need for predator management will require linking reduced demographic rates to habitat quality (fragmentation or degradation) or predator populations out of the natural range of variability (exotic species of subsidized populations). Alternatively, managers might consider predator management in translocation efforts to buffer recently released individuals from potentially elevated predation rates.

Small mammal abundance was estimated by snap trapping rodents and by counting pellets of snowshoe hares Lepus americanus in the Yellowknife area. Because small mammal data were not available for the same area as mallard harvest survey data, correlation with an estimate of ruffed grouse Bonasa umbellus harvest was used because small mammal abundance and grouse are known to correlate positively.

A negative correlation between snowshoe hare abundance and lesser scaup productivity was also found as well as a negative correlation between ruffed grouse abundance and mallard productivity. Negative correlations suggest a possible shared predation relationship, where changes in main prey abundance (hares) may cause a numerical response in predators that influences predation rates of shared alternative prey (ducks, eggs and ducklings).

In this study, the plasma leptin, ghrelin and growth hormone (GH) concentrations of male arctic foxes were determined during a food deprivation period of 13 days and the subsequent recovery in November and May. Leptin, ghrelin and GH were present in arctic fox plasma in amounts comparable to other carnivores. The plasma leptin concentrations did not react to food deprivation unlike in humans and rodents. However, the leptin levels increased during re-feeding as an indicator of increasing energy reserves. The relatively high ghrelin-leptin ratio, decrease in the plasma ghrelin concentration, an increase in the circulating GH concentrations and the observed negative correlation between plasma ghrelin and free fatty acid levels during fasting suggest that these hormones take part in the weight-regulation and energy metabolism of this species by increasing fat utilisation during food deprivation.

Here we show how the response of demographic rates of an arctic bird of prey to fluctuations in small rodent abundance changed when small rodent community composition and dynamics changed, possibly under the effect of climate warming. We observed the breeding biology of rough-legged buzzards (Buteo lagopus) at the Erkuta Tundra Monitoring Site in southern Yamal, low arctic Russia, for 19 years (1999-2017). At the same time, data on small rodent abundance were collected and information on buzzard diet was obtained from pellet dissection. The small rodent community experienced a shift from high-amplitude cycles to dampened fluctuations paralleled with a change in species composition toward less lemmings and more voles. Buzzards clearly preferred lemmings as prey. Breeding density of buzzards was positively related to small rodent abundance, but the shift in small rodent community lead to lower numbers relative to small rodent abundance. At the same time, after the change in small rodent community, the average number of fledglings was higher relative to small rodent abundance than earlier. These results suggest that the buzzard population adapted to a certain degree to the changes in the major resource, although at the same time density declined. The documented flexibility in the short-term response of demographic rates to changes in structure and dynamics of key food web components make it difficult to predict how complex food webs will be transformed in a warmer Arctic. The degree of plasticity of functional responses is indeed likely to vary between species and between regions, depending also on the local food web context.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Little is known so far on the predation pressure on non-passerine nests in tall swards. Investigations on the interaction of land use with nesting site conditions and the habitat selection of nest predators are crucial to develop effective conservation measures for grassland birds. In this study, we used artificial nests baited with quail and plasticine eggs to identify potential predators of ground nests in floodplain meadows and related predation risk to vegetation structure and grassland management. Mean daily predation rate was 0.01 ( [plus or minus] 0.012) after an exposure duration of 21 days. 70% of all observed nest predations were caused by mammals (Red Fox and mustelids) and 17.5% by avian predators (corvids). Nest sites close to the meadow edge and those providing low forb cover were faced with a higher daily predation risk. Predation risk also increased later in the season. Land use in the preceding year had a significant effect on predation risk, showing higher predation rates on unmanaged sites than on mown sites. Unused meadows probably attract mammalian predators, because they provide a high abundance of small rodents and a more favourable vegetation structure for foraging, increasing also the risk of incidental nest predations. Although mowing operation is a major threat to ground-nesting birds, our results suggest that an annual removal of vegetation may reduce predation risk in the subsequent year.",NA,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,Predation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we document how the extent of superpredation has changed over time, and assessed the impact of such temporal variation on local mesopredator populations using 40 yr of dietary data collected from a recovering population of northern goshawks Accipiter gentilis, an archetypical avian superpredator. We then assessed which mechanisms were driving variation in superpredation, e.g. was it opportunistic, a response to food becoming limited (due to declines in preferred prey) or to reduce competition. Raptors comprised 8% of goshawk diet on average in years when goshawk abundance was high, which is higher than reported elsewhere. Additionally, there was a per capita increase in superpredation as goshawks recovered, with the proportion of goshawk diet comprising raptors increasing from 2 to 8% as the number of goshawk home-ranges increased from 14 to 25. This increase in superpredation coincided with a population decline in the most commonly killed mesopredator, the Eurasian kestrel Falco tinnunculus, which may represent the reversal of the mesopredator release' process (i.e. mesopredator suppression) which occurred after goshawks and other large raptors declined or were extirpated. Food limitation was the most likely driver of superpredation in this system given: 1) the substantial decline of two main prey groups in goshawk diet, the increase in diet diversity and decrease in goshawk reproductive success are all consistent with the goshawk population becoming food-limited; 2) it's unlikely to be purely opportunistic as the increase in superpredation did not reflect changes in the availability of mesopredator species; and 3) the majority of mesopredators killed by goshawks do not compete with goshawks for food or nest sites.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Populations of predators and their prey are affected by changing climate and other anthropogenic factors, and these changing trophic interactions could have profound effects on breeding populations of Arctic birds. Variable abundance of lemmings (a primary prey of generalist Arctic predators) and increasing abundance of light geese (Lesser Snow and Ross' Geese; a secondary prey) could have negative consequences for numerous sympatric shorebirds (an incidental prey). Using 16 years of predator-prey observations and 13-years of shorebird nest survival data at a site near a goose colony we identify relationships among geese, lemmings, and their shared predators and then relate predator indices to shorebird risk of nest predation. During two years, we also placed time-lapse cameras and artificial shorebird nests at increasing distances from a goose colony to document spatial trends in predators and their effect on risk of predation. In the long-term data, yearly indices of light geese positively influenced indices of gulls and jaegers, and shorebird nest predation rate was negatively correlated with jaeger and fox indices. All three predator indices were highest near the goose colony and artificial nest predation probability was negatively correlated with distance from goose colony, but these effects were less apparent during the second year. Combined, these results highlight the variation in predator-mediated interactions between geese and shorebirds and outline one mechanism by which hyperabundant geese may be contributing to local or regional declines in Arctic-nesting shorebird populations.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pacific Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima v-nigra) nest on unvegetated, barrier islands: often near nesting Glaucous Gulls (Larus hyperboreus). Nest-site choice likely reflects a strategy of predator avoidance: nesting on islands to avoid mammalian predators and near territorial gulls to avoid other avian predators. We observed a nesting colony of Common Eiders from first nest initiation through nesting termination on Egg Island near Prudhoe Bay, Alaska (2002 - 2003). Resident gulls depreciated many eider nests, mostly during initiation. All nests failed when an Arctic Fox (Alopex lagopus) visited the island and flushed hens from their nests, exposing the eggs to depredation by the fox and gulls (resident and non-resident). Common Eiders actively defended nests from gulls, but not from foxes. Likely all three species (i.e.. eiders, gulls. and foxes) ultimately achieved negligible benefit from their nest-site selection or predatory activity: (a) island nesting provided no safety from mammalian predators for ciders or gulls. (b) for Common Eiders, nesting near gulls increased egg loss, (c) for Glaucous Gulls, nesting near colonial ciders may have reduced nest success by attracting the fox, and (d) for Arctic Foxes, the depredation was of questionable value, as most eggs were cached and probably not recoverable (due to damage from fall storms).

1448,"Kahlert, Johnny and Asferg, Tommy and Odderskaer, Peter",2008,[The biology and population regulation of the grey partridge. A review of the current state of knowledge.],NERI Technical Report,666,NA,"This report presents the results of a literature study on grey partridge based upon peer-reviewed papers, reports and popular articles from Denmark and abroad. The literature study should be considered as a supplement to on-going studies on grey partridge under the research programme ""Wildlife and Landscape"" The report considers four main issues[center dot]1) changes in European partridge populations during the last 50-60 years, 2) general biology, 3) causes of the observed population trends and, 4) management of grey partridge in different European countries. Although the report considers the different issues from an overall European perspective, from the outset emphasis is placed on aspects that relate specifically to Danish partridges and their particular circumstances. New analyses of existing data are presented derived from the Danish hunting bag statistics and point counts organ- ised by the Danish Ornithological Society. The collation of bird count survey data and the results of analysis of bag statistics showed that grey partridge has suffered from a significant de- cline in numbers during the last 50-60 years, and in Denmark the num- ber of shot partridge currently equates to less than 10% of those taken around 1940. In many countries, falling numbers seem to have shown a stepwise decline and to certain extent these patterns appear synchro- nized between countries. In Denmark five periods of significant decline can be identified[center dot]1) early 1950s, 2) early 1960s, 3) around 1980, 4) late 1990s and finally from 2003 to 2006. Since 1994, the number of bagged partridges (a proxy for changes in population size) has fallen in 11 out of 13 years. Declines were reported from all regions of Denmark, which were also confirmed by the national point count surveys. In recent years, the decline in the number of bagged partridges may overestimate the ac- tual decline in numbers due to a reduced hunting effort on grey partridge. A review of the biology of the grey partridge revealed certain characteristics. [center dot] The grey partridge is relatively short-lived (on the average less than one year), but produces a large clutch (10-20 eggs). Accordingly, the species is relatively susceptible to changes in reproductive output (egg and chick production). However, these characteristics of par-tridge population dynamics give the potential for relatively rapid restoration to abundance after a decline, as long as the factors responsible for the declines are reduced in magnitude or removed. [center dot] The grey partridge is consistently associated with farmland throughout the annual life cycle; showing particular preferences for areas that are not directly associated with production[center dot]small uncultivated areas, hedgerows, field margins and uncropped wildlife strips. These habitats contribute to provide various basics needs, including adequate available food resources; cover for nesting and predation avoidance for adults and chicks. [center dot] Adults grey partridges feed almost exclusively on plant material, especially seeds from weed and green leaves from grasses and small cereal plants. During the first weeks after hatching, chicks primarily feed on insects. [center dot] Grey partridge shows little dispersal. Twelve studies within Europe have shown that the average dispersal remained at maximum 3.5 km. The decline amongst European partridges has mainly been linked to changes in agriculture since 1950. During this period, the size and distribution of small uncultivated areas has reduced significantly. Hence, many potential nest and feeding habitats have disappeared. The use of herbicides and insecticides has also limited food resources considerably for both adults and chicks. New analyses of data from Denmark confirmed that severe winters together with low temperatures and heavy rainfall during the chick period explain a substantial proportion of the year to year change in the numbers of bagged partridges since 1941. Bag statistics on red fox (as an index of population change in this important predator) suggest its abundance has some impact on grey partridge abundance, but to a lesser extent than weather conditions. In addition to red fox, grey partridge are predated by other species, including birds of prey and mustelids. Studies in Denmark and elsewhere indicate cases where locally grey partridge hunting is clearly not sustainable, along side other examples presented in the report where the hunt is considered sustainable in different European countries. Guidance on how to attain a sustainable partridge hunt varied considerably between case studies, and is not necessarily based on scientific evidence. Advice ranges from official recommendations from authorities to what is considered as common sense amongst hunters. There are no indications that diseases and parasites amongst grey partridge should have played a major role in the changes in numbers. The issue is, however, not supported by in-depth studies to the present time. It may be that grey partridge densities in some places (including areas in Denmark) have become so low that this in itself may increase the risk of further declines. The low dispersal rate of the species contributes to this fact. In many European countries, hand-raised grey partridges are released to supplement ""wild"" populations. Released partridges typical suffer from lower survival rate after release, the main reason why release projects have not restored partridge populations to previous levels on a larger geographical scale. It is concluded that the grey partridge still has the potential to maintain a dramatic increase in numbers, mainly because of their potential for very high annual reproductive output. If the present predictions for climate change are manifest, future weather conditions are likely to be beneficial to Danish partridges. However, the interaction of compounding factors that presently limit the grey partridge in contemporary Danish farmland, means that more than just one of the underlying factors important for population changes must prevail, if the grey partridge is to be successfully restored to previous population levels. At a number of sites throughout Europe, positive effects on grey partridge population densities have been demonstrated at the local level after the provision of targeted measures, which improve the habitat in agricultural areas. This report reviews these measures and presents a synthesis of the generally good match across different European countries of what is considered as habitat improvement and enhancement for grey partridge. These recommendations include increasing the availability of nest sites and enhancing chick survival as well as winter and spring survival amongst adults. So far, these improvements have not had a significant impact on partridge numbers on the national scale, most likely because they have been carried out on a relatively small part of the total farmland area.",NA,,JRY,Phasianidae,No,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detritus web decorations built by certain orb-web spider species are thought to deflect avian predator attacks away from spiders and towards their web decorations. Still, empirical evidence for this function and its adaptive significance is lacking. The orb-web spider,Cyclosa monticola, adorns its web using a linear detritus decoration consisting of moults, egg sacs, prey remains and leaf litters. In the present study, we investigated whether detritus decorations constructed byC. monticolaspiders divert attacks of avian predators away from spiders. We first employed colour modelling to compare spider bodies and detritus decoration colouration from the perspective of domestic chicks and blue tits. We then experimentally tested the deflection hypothesis in the laboratory using naive chicks as predators. We put the chicks in a cage containing a web either with (S+) or without (S-) a spider and either with (D+) or without (D-) detritus decoration (a total of four types of webs: S+D+, S+D-, S-D+ and S-D-) under both natural habitat background and white background. We found that the colour ofC. monticolaspiders is indistinguishable from that of their detritus decorations for both chicks and blue tits with both backgrounds. Laboratory predation experiments showed that with both backgrounds, chicks attacked the spiders much less frequently when their decorations were present on the webs (S+D+; natural habitat: 20%, white background: 30%) than when their decorations were absent (S+D-; natural habitat: 95%, white background: 85%), resulting in greater spider survival advantage. We also found that the rate of attack of spiders and their decorations was not random; the decorations were more likely to be attacked than spiders, regardless of the ratio of surface area of decorations to spider bodies when both spiders and decorations were presented (S+D+). Therefore, our results support a deflection, rather than concealment hypothesis for web decorations. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that the extended phenotypes beyond the animal bodies, can divert avian predator attacks, therefore, may improve the fitness of animals.

A total of 120 quail chicks of four weeks of age were assigned into six groups and given basal feed, Cd1 (150 mg.kg-1 feed), Cd2 (300 mg.kg-1 feed) and SL (250 mg.kg-1 feed) alone and in combinations for 60 days. Hematological parameters, serum biochemical profile, feed intake, bodyweights, relative organ weights, egg production and histopathological alterations in kidney and oviduct were noted. Our results showed dose dependent decrease in mean relative weight of oviduct but increase in liver, intestine, kidney and spleen in groups treated with Cd only. Feed intake was decreased in Cd groups compared with control and bodyweight of Cd treated groups was lower as compared with control and SL groups. The Hb and PCV values were low but higher values of blood urea, creatinine, and serum activity of AST and ALT were observed in Cd treated groups only. Reduced height of mucosal folds collapsed tubular glands, nuclear degenerative changes and infiltration of plasma cells in parenchymatous tissue of oviduct were observed in Cd treated groups only. Moreover, Cd exposure resulted into hemorrhage, casts in tubules, infiltration of mononuclear cells, tubular necrosis and fibrosis in kidneys. Egg production was also lower in Cd treated groups as compared with control group. It may be concluded that Cd has strong nephrotoxic and gonadotoxic effects and SL may effectively ameliorate these toxic effects completely at lower doses but partially at higher doses of Cd.

Due to the existence of animal personality, individuals within a population may exhibit different food-scratching patterns. This study tested the impacts of personality traits (i.e., boldness and exploration) on food-scratching behaviour and food intake of Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica). We found that boldness and exploration were repeatable, respectively, and were correlated. When entering a food patch, proactive (i.e., bolder and more explorative) quails scratched for food earlier and more frequently with a longer time. Frequent and longer food-scratching may motivate longer foraging time in proactive quails which can get more food intake. The correlation between personality and food intake was sex dependent. Proactive females had more food intake during the first half of the foraging process and the correlation became weak as time went on. The pattern was opposite in males. In conclusion, our study suggests that personality traits have significant effects on animals' food-searching strategies which may be correlated with their foraging success and fitness. Overall foraging success and ultimate fitness of an individual animal is highly dependent on their food-searching strategies, which are the focus of foraging theory. Considering the consistent inter-individual behavioural differences, personality may have a fundamental impact on animal food-scratching behaviour, which remains largely unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate how personality traits (i.e., boldness and exploration) affect the food-scratching behaviour and food intake of the domestic Japanese quail Coturnix japonica during the foraging process. The quails exhibited significant repeatability in boldness and exploration, which also constituted a behavioural syndrome. More proactive, that is, bolder and more explorative, individuals scratched the ground more frequently for food and began scratching earlier in a patch. Individuals that scratched more frequently had a longer foraging time and a higher food intake. The correlation between personality traits and temporary food intake during every 2 min varied over time and was sex dependent, with females exhibiting a positive correlation during the first half of the foraging stage and males after the initial stage. These findings suggest that personality traits affect the food-scratching behaviour and, thus, the food intake of quails. Our study provides insights into the impact of personality traits on animal's foraging behaviour by influencing their food-searching strategies.",NA,,JME,Phasianidae,No,,No,captive feeding experiment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The experiment was 7 days for adaption and 67 days for trial period. The parameters of growth performance, fur quality, organ development and body energy deposition were evaluated by means of feeding, slaughter trials and chemical analysis methods. The results showed as follows: 1) With the decrease of feeding level, ADFI showed an extremely significant decrease (P<0.01), ADG in group II was extremely significantly higher than that in group IV (P<0. 01), and significantly higher than that in group III (P<0. 05), and there was no significant difference between group II and I (P>0. 05). Final weight (FW) and F/G were not significantly different among different groups(P>0. 05), whereas the FW in group II were higher than those in the other groups, and F/G in group II were lower than those in the other groups. 2) Different feeding levels extremely significantly affected length of fresh pelt (P<0. 01). Length of fresh pelt in group I was extremely significantly higher than those in group III and IV (P<0. 01), and no significant difference was found between group I and II (P>0. 05).

The number shot for sport at Rickarton moor in northeast Scotland. for example, has cycled with 10-11-yr periodicity since 1946. Here, demographic and other causes of a population cycle were documented from 1979-1989, and an experiment tested the prediction that removing some cocks during the increase phase would prevent subsequent cyclic decline. Throughout the study, sport shooting was stopped on the area where the main work was done. During 1979-1982, before the experimental removal of cocks began, numbers over the whole moor rose from a trough at the start of the study. On the control area, the cyclic peak in 1983 was followed by a decline until 1988, as predicted in advance from models derived from a previous study elsewhere. On the experimental area, enough territorial cocks were removed each spring from 1982 to 1986 to prevent the population from attaining peak densities for five successive years, and no cyclic decline occurred. The removal of cocks resulted in similar numbers of hens being lost from the breeding population. The main demographic cause of population change on control (cycling) and experimental (cycle broken) areas was variation in the recruitment of young cocks to the spring population. On the control area, recruitment was related to cycle phase and breeding success. Changes in food, nitrogen metabolism, and parasite burdens could not explain the cycle. Demographic patterns were consistent with a model in which changes in age structure affected recruitment. These and previous results refute four hypotheses as necessary causes of population cycles in Red Grouse: (1) maternal nutrition, (2) a version of Chitty's genetic hypothesis, (3) host-parasite (caecal threadworm), and (4) predator-prey relationships.

Humans can similarly be exposed to ammunition-derived lead when consuming wild-shot game animals. Studies have assessed the degree of lead contamination in the carcasses of game animals but this scrutiny has not so far extended to Australia. Stubble quail (Coturnix pectoralis) are one of the only native non-waterfowl bird species that can be legally hunted in Australia, where it is commonly hunted with lead shot. The aim of this study was to characterize lead contamination in quail harvested with lead-based ammunition. The frequency, dimensions, and number of lead fragments embedded in carcasses were assessed through use of radiography (X-ray). From these data, the average quantity of lead available to scavenging wildlife was estimated along with potential risks to human consumers. We radiographed 37 stubble quail harvested by hunters using 12-gauge (2.75"") shotguns to fire shells containing 28 g (1 oz) of #9 (2 mm or 0.08"" diameter) lead shot in western Victoria, Australia, in Autumn 2021. Radiographs revealed that 81% of carcasses contained embedded pellets and/or fragments with an average of 1.62 embedded pellets detected per bird. By excising and weighing a sample of 30 shotgun pellets (all had a mass of 0.75 grain or 48.6 mg), we calculated an average lead load of 78 mg/100 g of body mass. This was a conservative estimate, because fragments were not considered. This level of lead contamination was comparable to hunted bird species examined using similar methods in Europe. The quantity and characteristics of lead ammunition residues found suggest that predatory and scavenging wildlife and some groups of human consumers will be at risk of negative health impacts.",NA,,JME,Phasianidae,,,No,lead ammunition poisoning,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has a large population of arctic foxes Alopex lagopus, which are hunted intensively. This paper is an abstract and recalculation of the results from three recent Russian publications (KRYLOV 1989, KUKSOV 1989, KOKOREV AND KUKSOV 2002) that describe various aspects of the arctic fox population in Tajmyr during 1960-2001. The foxes fed mainly on lemmings and had population cycles similar to those of their prey. The proportion of occupied fox dens was related to the lemming-index, being ten times larger in years of high lemming abundance (on average 49.8 %, vs. 4.4 % when lemming abundance was low). Maximum 81 % of the dens were occupied in any given year. The arctic fox had fairly regular 3-4 years population cycles. No significant variation with time was found (1960-1999), but den occupancy was relatively high in the 1970ies. The cycle was divided into four phases; increase, high, decrease and low. The mean litter size in these phases varied by 1.73 pups, and was 6.66 pups during the phase when most litters were born (high). Hunting appears to have had little influence on the arctic fox population, except in years when the population was low and food was limited. Most foxes killed were either very young or old. Large migrations of foxes appear to have been common, and ""empty"" areas may have had an influx of foxes when food conditions improved. Younger foxes were thus supposed to have replaced old residents, implying that the killing of older foxes had little effect on the population increase. The number of foxes killed varied between 1 000 and 34 000, comprising 4-43 % of the population. The mean total population size (in November) in Tajmyr was estimated to be 102 000, 177 000, 35 000 and 18 000 foxes in the increase, high, decrease and low phases, respectively. A total of 2 600 dens were examined, and the total number of dens was estimated to be 57 000, the density varying between 0.04 and 0.22 dens/km2. The methods are however poorly described and it is not possible to evaluate the reliability of most of these estimates. However, it is clear that the arctic fox population in Tajmyr was very large, considering both the size of the region, the density of dens and the number of foxes trapped each year. This must be the result of a relatively high primary productivity and high lemming abundance, despite the arctic characteristics of the region. A lack of red foxes Vulpes vulpes may also explain the large arctic fox population. In Fennoscandia the density of arctic fox dens is estimated to be comparatively low, but they are large and possibly larger than those in Tajmyr.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In contrast, in quail, in which other studies have shown that most thyroid maturation occurs during the embryonic and perihatch periods, the circulating concentrations of T-3 and T-4 showed little posthatch ontogenic change. Plasma concentrations of both GH and IGF-I showed similar patterns in both species with a posthatch rise (peak at 3 days in starlings and 8 days in quail), followed by a decline.

These data were integrated with values obtained from the literature on body mass, assimilation efficiency, body reserve consumption and deposition rates, chick growth and energy expenditure and energy content of food in a new type of algorithm to predict (with 95% confidence limits (CL)) foraging success and daily changes in body mass. A successfully breeding pair of macaroni penguins will capture 111.7 kg (95% CL: 79.4 to 158.0 kg) of prey during the chick-rearing period. The crucial phase of the chick rearing period was around the time that chicks creche, when prey consumption rates more than doubled as the male assisted in foraging and recovered from a long fast. Female macaroni penguins extracted 2.28 (1.60 to 3.26) and males extracted 2.84 (2.02 to 3.99) g of prey from their environment for every minute spent submerged during foraging. Only 15.3 (14.7 to 15.6)% of all prey consumed was fed to chicks. While food capture rates increase in the middle of the breeding season, this may be more a function of greater food availability than a response to demands from their chick. Male and female macaroni penguins have differing breeding strategies with the male showing the characteristics of a capital then income breeder while the female has a strategy that shows characteristics of both capital and income strategies simultaneously. The high synchronicity and precise timing of the macaroni penguin breeding season and timing of the increase in prey capture rates suggest an influx of prey to their foraging area during the middle of the breeding season. A depletion of prey resources in the foraging area used during the breeding season could affect foraging success and have profound effects on the body condition and composition of this species and its ability to raise chicks successfully.",10.3354/meps07024,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The initial breeding trials failed, probably because of stress among captive animals, and the programme was radically changed in 2005. Eight large enclosures within the species' historical natural habitat were established, which had the positive effect of all pairs breeding in 2007.

After just four to seven years of releases, populations have been effectively re-established in three mountain areas where the species had been locally extinct. One of the newly re-established populations has become the largest population in Norway. Several other populations, including Swedish ones, have benefited considerably from successful immigration of released foxes.

However, temporal dynamics of biological responses are most often ignored in fields such as dietary supplementation of farm animals exposed to artificial environmental challenges. Herein, we hypothesized that the potential for thymol (2-isopropyl-5-methylphenol) to alleviate physiological and behavioral consequences of heat stress is time-dependent on both long-term (i.e. weeks) and short-term (i.e. within day) time scales. First, during 3-weeks adult female Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica) were exposed daily to 9h of increased environmental temperature (34.2 [plus or minus] 0.1 [degree]C). Controls remained at standard temperatures (23.6 [plus or minus] 0.1 [degree]C). Simultaneously, half received thymol dietary supplementation and the other half a control basal diet. On day 4, both thymol and heat stress decreased body weight and feed intake respect to controls (basal, standard temperature). After three weeks, feed intake recovered for thymol groups. Therefore, we performed a second experiment focused on the critical first week of treatment, sampling variables three times a day. The beneficial effects of thymol supplementation were mainly observed during the morning, including prevention of high respiratory rates and reduction in the weight of droppings induced by heat stress, and increased walking under both temperatures.

Predator-prey interactions are common in nature, and predation environment is the main driving force for the evolution of prey phenotypes (e.g. personalities). To investigate interspecific differences in the personalities of prey fish species and the effects of their predator, Channa argus was used as the predator, Rhodeus ocellatus and Pseudorasbora parva, which usually form mixed populations in nature, were used as the prey fish in this study. The prey fish were exposed to predator treatment or no predator treatment for one month, using the common garden experiment. Subsequently, the personalities, including exploration, activity and boldness of two prey fish species were measured, and the interspecific differences of different personalities and their environmental dependence were analyzed. The results showed that: (1) There were significant interspecific differences in personality between the two prey fish species. The exploration, activity and boldness of R. ocellatus were significantly stronger than those of the P. parva, regardless of whether they had undergone predator treatment or not (P<0.05). (2) Predator experience led to enhanced exploration and boldness of two prey fish species but had no significant effect on the activity of both (P>0.05). (3) Predator attenuated the interspecific differences of different personalities between two prey fish species and strengthened the coupling of their individual different personalities. The results suggested that the personalities of the prey fish have significant differences between species and both have a predator effect. Predator experience leads to the decrease of interspecific differences in the personalities of the two prey fish species, showing a trend of convergent adaptation.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Understanding the physiological effects of this compound may clarify whether the association between annual fluctuations in CB and Ruffed Grouse population levels has a cause/effect relationship. We determined the maximum level of dietary CB that Ruffed Grouse can tolerate by feeding captive grouse a formulated diet treated with eight concentrations of CB. Loss of body mass was used to indicate toxicity. Biotransformation products from CB were identified in order to determine the detoxication mechanisms employed and the presence of potentially toxic CB metabolites. Ruffed Grouse will consume up to 2 g kg-1 day-1 of CB before rapid mass loss ensues. High dietary levels of CB were associated with. decreased food intake and increased water excretion. Serum uric acid, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase levels did not change significantly with increased levels of dietary CB. Mass loss that was associated with a CB intake of 2.3 g kg-1 day-1 could be explained by decreased food intake but could not be attributed to any specific toxic effect. It is uncertain whether the decreased food consumption that occurred at high CB intake levels was prompted by toxicity avoidance or decreased food palatability. Ruffed Grouse appear to use glucuronic acid, sulfate, and ornithine conjugation, along with hydrolysis, reduction, and oxygenation reactions, when detoxifying CB. Nine biotransformation products were identified, including ferulic acid and 4-vinylguaiacol.

We detected little temporal segregation between the nocturnal activities of jaguars, pumas, and ocelots, although pumas were more active closer to dawn. Jaguars had low activity overlap with species likely to be common prey, whereas ocelots had high overlap with their potential prey. Pumas displayed finer-scale similarities in activity with species likely to be common prey.

Breeding territories of raptors and owls were mapped according to their territorial behaviour, repeated observations, nests or fledglings. Reproductive success was estimated with standard methods (e.g. L5hmus et al. 1997). General diet composition of Buteo buteo, Strix aluco and Asia otus was determined from pellets and prey remains, but insects and bird feathers were excluded from material (birds were initially classified only as non-passerines and passerines).

Altogether, 13 species (7 Accipitriformes, 2 falcons and 4 owls) were found as breeders (Table 1). The total annual number of breeding territories was 30-55 (mean 44). Species of cultural landscape were most numerous, but also high numbers of Circus aeruginosus were characteristic. Accipiter gentilis and Falco tinnunculus disappeared as breeders during the study.

Responses of martens included reduced population density, enlarged home ranges, lower ovulation rates in females aged 1 and 2 years, reduced production of young, dispersal of formerly resident adults during the 2nd year of scarce food, and cannibalism. Dispersal of residents resulted in an unexpectedly high trapping success in 1983, suggesting that fur returns do not reflect changing population levels for marten. Male body weights did not differ among years but females weighed more in early winter of scarce food years compared to the same period when food was abundant (P .ltoreq. 0.01).

One cost is that reproduction decreases survival probabilities of attendant individuals, which may have a major effect on population demography. During brood rearing, adults of precocial species usually make extensive movements to lead their young to sites with adequate food resources and dense cover. However, few studies have evaluated the effects of brood movement on attendant precocial adults. In this study, we tracked female Chinese Grouse during brood-rearing periods using radiotelemetry at Lianhuashan Nature Reserve, Gansu, China, during 2010-2012, to evaluate the effects of brood rearing and movement distances on females' survival probabilities using known fate models in program MARK. All 41 females attempted to breed, and 30 females successfully hatched at least one chick; 11 failed during the incubation period. Although females with broods moved more extensively than females without broods, movement distances did not influence survival probabilities of attendant females. Seven females with broods were killed by predators, resulting in a lower survival probability (0.958 [plus or minus] 0.016 weekly survival and 0.679 [plus or minus] 0.099 through the 9-weeks brood-rearing periods) than for females without broods, which all survived the brood-rearing periods.

Using over 20 years of data, we examine influences on the reproductive output of the small, but recently expanding, population of Welsh hen harriers. Productivity (fledglings per breeding attempt) has steadily increased with time, being the highest in recent years. Available evidence suggested that food availability could not account for these recent increases. Human interference (apparently, largely or entirely in the form of nest destruction by grouse moor gamekeepers) had a large influence on productivity, despite being restricted to a minority of the breeding population. This negative effect, and a positive effect of May temperature, was most influential on variation in breeding productivity. This study quantifies, for the first time, that cessation of persecution can result in a marked improvement in hen harrier reproductive output. Nest predation by red foxes Vulpes vulpes had no effect on variation in breeding productivity and there was no evidence that control of fox numbers by gamekeepers compensated for their depression of productivity through destroying harrier nests. Our analyses also indicated that gamekeepers probably destroyed an unknown number of nests before they were discovered. We argue that a low proportion of territorial females that apparently breed, in cases when clutch size and fledged brood size are high, may be an indication of persecution. The recent increase in the breeding productivity of Welsh harriers has probably been influential in the recent recovery of the Welsh harrier population and has apparently been due to a combination of cessation of human interference and warmer temperatures.",10.1111/j.1469-1795.2008.00164.x,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Arctic tundra is a low productivity ecosystem supporting simple food webs, but several predators often feed on the same prey species, lemmings, known for their large-amplitude population fluctuations. We examined mechanisms involved in reducing intra-guild competition and allowing coexistence of four avian predators (snowy owls, glaucous gulls, rough-legged hawks and long-tailed jaegers) feeding on a pulsed resource (brown and collared lemmings). We compared the size and species of prey consumed by predators to see if resource partitioning occurred. We also verified if spatial segregation in nesting areas could be another mechanism allowing coexistence. Finally, we tested if the absence of the snowy owl, a dominant and irruptive species, triggered a competitive release on the smallest predator, the jaeger, with respect to prey size and nesting area used. We monitored the breeding of predators and lemming abundance over a 14-year period on Bylot Island, Canada. We mapped their nesting sites and collected regurgitation pellets to recover lemming mandibles, which were used to infer prey species and size. The size of lemmings consumed varied among species with the largest predators consuming the largest lemmings and the smallest predators consuming the smallest lemmings. All predators consumed more collared than brown lemmings compared to their availability although owls and jaegers consumed relatively more brown lemmings compared to gulls and hawks. Jaegers consumed larger lemmings in the absence of owls than in their presence, suggestive of a short-term competitive release. We found moderate to low overlap in nesting areas among predators and no evidence of their expansion in the absence of owls, suggesting that spatial distribution is caused by species-specific habitat preferences. The main mechanism to partition food resources among these avian predators is spatial segregation, and secondarily prey size and species. However, we found evidence that food competition is still present and leads to a niche shift in the smallest predator of the guild. Interspecific competition may thus be a pervasive force in simple, low productivity food webs characterized by pulsed resources.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Regression analysis showed a positive correlation between each of the parameters (except dry mass of caecal faces) and body mass, reflecting a relationship between differences in chemical composition of the browse in the diets and its digestibility. Modelling intermediary metabolism in three grouse species revealed that about 50% of metabolizable energy originated from carbohydrate oxidation: the rest was shared among fiber (9-35%), protein (9-14%), and crude fat (12-25%). The more nitrogen in the diet, the higher were estimates of total digestibility, as well as those of fiber and fat. A generalized model of nitrogen demands of individuals is proposed and predictions from the model are compared with particular determinations based upon actual data from different species. The digestibility of natural grouse diet, and consequently available energy, is essentially dependent upon the concentration of protein in the diet. This suggests that it is necessary for grouse to exceed the minimal physiological level of nitrogen intake, not only to create reserves, but also to function effectively in the presumed need to detoxify and digest those fractions of the diet that are difficult to absorb.",10.1139/z88-203,,JME,Phasianidae,,,No,plant diet; elemental energy intake,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Increases in predator populations and nest predation may play an important role in this decline, along with habitat loss. However, the role of various predators has often remained unclear. We conducted a study with artificial nests and wildlife cameras (n=104) in agricultural landscapes during 2015-2016 in South Finland. Our trials formed a 400-m wide gradient from forest to field. The aim of our study was to monitor nest survival and nest predators in a spatial and temporal scale. We tested the effect of distance to the forest and nest visibility to nest predation. During an 8-day period, 39.4% of the artificial nests were predated. Fifty percent of the predators were birds, 40% mammals, and 10% remained unknown. The three dominant predators of our artificial nests were the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) with 11 nests and the hooded crow (Corvus corone cornix) and the magpie (Pica pica) with 10 depredated nests each. Our analysis indicates that avian predators preyed upon nests in open fields further away from the forest edge, whereas mammalian predation concentrated closer to the forest edge. Predation occurred more likely at the beginning of the survey and nest survival increased as days passed. Our study highlights the efficiency of using wildlife camera traps in nest predation studies. We also suggest that the ongoing expansion of alien predators across Europe may have a greater impact on ground-nesting bird populations than previously anticipated.",NA,,JME,No,,,No,predators; artificial nests,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the case of the Caribbean spiny lobster, Panulirus argus (Latreille, 1804), and red grouper, Epinephelus mono (Valenciennes, 1928), both are important fishery species commonly found co-occurring in Florida Bay habitats. Red grouper are known to prey upon juvenile lobsters but karst solution holes excavated by red grouper often host large groups of lobsters. A combination of experiments tested the effect of red grouper on different lobster size classes to determine how this interaction changes through lobster ontogeny: red grouper were excluded from solution holes to test the effect of grouper presence on the abundance of each lobster size class; artificial dens were constructed to test the avoidance behaviors of small lobsters to red grouper; and a tethering experiment tested how lobster survival varied across size classes. Lobster abundance in solution holes with red grouper increased more than in holes where the grouper was removed (126% versus 16.9%), but this effect was strongest on adult and large immature lobsters. Experiments with artificial dens showed no effect of caged grouper presence on the abundance of small lobsters. Survival of tethered lobsters was lowest for small juveniles but again differed significantly between size classes. Overall, the distribution of lobsters in solution holes appears to be driven primarily by asymmetrical predation risk from red grouper through lobster ontogeny. Shifts in this interaction across life stages may play an important role in structuring the Caribbean spiny lobster population in Florida Bay.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A traditional rearing system of PRMs was usually established by using chickens as the host. However, the system with chickens had some defects, such as high feed consumption, large amount of feces, high cost, and intensive labor. In present study, we used quails as the host to rear mites, and compared the reproductive efficiency of this new system with that of the chicken system. The results showed that the number of mites increased 96-fold and the number of eggs increased 50-fold after four weeks in the quail system, which were significantly higher than those in the system with chickens. The survival rates of mites in both systems were higher than 95%, and the value in the quail system at the fourth week was significantly better than that of the chicken system. The statistical results of feed consumption, live weight, and daily excrement of chickens and quails showed that the quail system was more stable with less feed consumption and less waste excretion than the chicken system. Comparing the number of eggs laid by each female mite, hatching rates and molting rates in both systems, we can conclude that the breeding system, in which quails replaced chickens as hosts, had no effect on the fecundity of D. gallinae.

We present 50 years of data on constant-effort catches of red knot Calidris canutus and curlew sandpiper C. ferruginea at an autumn migratory stopover site (Ottenby) at the Baltic Sea, supplemented with literature data on winter censuses of dark-bellied brent goose Branta b. bernicla and white-fronted goose Anser albifrons in northwestern Europe, and waders in Germany and Southern Africa. Number and proportion of juveniles in these bird populations (both our own and literature data) were compared with an index of predation pressure (calculated from the abundance of lemmings on the Taimyr peninsula), and climate indices for the North Eurasia and the North Atlantic regions. The index of predation pressure correlated significantly with the number of juveniles of red knot and curlew sandpiper, but not with number of adults. Also, this index correlated with the reproductive performance of geese and waders reported in the literature. Fourier analysis revealed a significant deviation from random noise with the maximum spectral density at the period length of 3 years for number of juvenile red knots and curlew sandpipers captured at Ottenby, abundance of lemmings, reproduction in arctic fox Alopex lagopus, and reproductive performance in geese on the Siberian tundra. Also, the date of passage at Ottenby for adult red knot and curlew sandpiper showed a spectral density peak at a period length of 3 years, the latter species also showing a peak at a period length of 5-6 years. Passage dates for adult red knot and curlew sandpiper were earlier in years of high predation pressure compared with years of low predation pressure. The fluctuations in reproductive success of the studied Siberian goose and wader species appear to be primarily influenced by biotic factors in the breeding area, rather than by abiotic factors, such as climate oscillations. Annual variations in migratory arctic bird populations may have far reaching effects in habitats along their migration routes and in their wintering areas. We suggest a link between lemming cyclicity in the Northern Hemisphere and predation pressure on Southern Hemisphere benthos, in which the signal is carried between continents by long distance migrating waders.",10.1007/s00442-002-1017-2,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Development of anti-predator behaviour may be impaired in captive conditions which favour low emotional reactivity, resulting in poor perception of danger. Therefore, the newly reintroduced, naive animals may not behave adaptively in terms of anti-predator vigilance, resulting in increased vulnerability to predators. Such behavioural deficiencies may have contributed to the low success rates of reintroductions, but few studies have measured post-release vigilance in captive-bred animals, and none has been published on reintroduced grey partridges. Therefore, in this study we investigated post-release vigilance behaviour and time budgets in coveys of captive-bred grey partridges (Perdix perdix: N = 26) released in autumn over two years. We observed the captive-bred grey partridge coveys in the field, and recorded their group vigilance rates as well as time budgets of individual behaviour, including vigilance and feeding. Released grey partridges had low group vigilance rates and showed poor individual vigilance (4-5% of time spent vigilant) compared to their wild counterparts (43% of time spent vigilant; Watson et al., 2007). Moreover, released individuals spent 30-48% of their time feeding, and fed at this rate throughout the day, instead of concentrating their feeding around dawn and dusk like wild grey partridges do. The revealed vigilance and feeding behaviour in released grey partridges are likely to increase vulnerability to predators, and therefore offer plausible explanations for the high predation rates of released grey partridges observed with these and previous releases. Rearing methods should be developed to encourage wariness in the captive animals. In addition, the adaptive bimodal feeding routine of wild grey partridges should be encouraged in the captive-bred birds, for example by feeding them only at dawn and dusk. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Availability of optimal prey can affect reproductive success in raptors, especially in the Arctic, where dramatic differences in prey availability occur both within and between years. However, behavioral responses of dietary specialist, resident predators such as Gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus) to changes in prey availability remain poorly understood. To improve understanding of how climate-driven changes in prey availability may affect diet of avian predators in the Arctic, we characterized Gyrfalcon diet on the Seward Peninsula, Alaska, in 2014 and 2015 from images representing 2008 prey items obtained by motion-activated cameras at 20 nests. We documented two important dietary shifts: the proportion of ptarmigan (Willow Ptarmigan (Lagopus lagopus) and Rock Ptarmigan (L. muta)) in the diet declined throughout the brood-rearing period in both years, and also differed between years. In both cases, ptarmigan were replaced by Arctic ground squirrels (Urocitellus parryii) in the diet. Despite shifts in prey composition, dietary breadth did not change, which revealed a facultative shift in prey use in which Gyrfalcons relied on prey of large size rather than prey of a particular taxon. We describe previously undocumented prey-use patterns during Gyrfalcon breeding, specifically an interchange between two prey species that are keystones in tundra ecology. These results are important for informing predictive models of climate change and adaptive species management plans. Further study of the interchange between prey types described in this study can strengthen insight into key ecosystem processes, and the cause and effect of potential decoupling of predator-prey interactions.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This relationship is thought to ultimately result in higher reproductive success for females paired with highly vigilant males. However, previous research has not examined the behavioural mechanism that produces the correlation between male vigilance and rates of female foraging. Foraging females may take advantage of vigilance that males are using for other purposes. Alternatively, the purpose of male vigilance may be to increase females' ability to forage. We examined these alternatives by testing whether vigilance preceded or followed bouts of female foraging more often than would occur by chance alone, using simultaneous behaviour observations of pre-incubation pairs of white-tailed ptarmigan (Lagopus leucurus). Our results indicate that each member of a pair may influence the behaviour of the other. Females were more likely to initiate foraging bouts after males became vigilant than if their mate remained non-vigilant. Moreover, non-vigilant males were more likely to become vigilant if their mate was foraging than if she was engaged in some other activity. Despite the possibility that a sexual conflict exists as each member of a pair attempts to maximize its fitness, both sexes behave as though a major role of male vigilance is to enhance female foraging opportunities.",10.1007/s002650050639,,JME,Phasianidae,No,,No,vigilance; time series experiment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Volume I.",NA,NA,"I watched six pairs of Gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus) in the central Yukon during the courtship period and recorded six courtship behaviors during 385 h of observation in 1980 when ptarmigan were abundant, and 465 h in 1981 when they were scarce, to determine if courtship provided the mechanism by which Gyrfalcon pairs adjust reproductive effort to ptarmigan num- bers. It appeared that courtship feeding was the principal cue, presumably through weight gain, to entice the female to the nest and invoke breeding. Courtship feeding dropped significantly from one year to the next, and was associated with the decline in the number of ptarmigan (one delivery per 27.5 h in 1980 versus one per 58.1 h in 1981), and was consistently higher from successful sites and those where laying was advanced. The reduced frequency of food delivery was associated with female apathy [long dash] less loyalty to the site and indifference to the nest. This prompted greater frequency of male courtship displays. These activities [long dash] nest visits, copulations, and aerial aero- batic displays [long dash] were more frequent and extended into the post-laying period when ptarmigan were scarce (1981), and were more evident of failed and delayed nests. The likely function of such behavior was to seduce passive females. Intense male displays, however, appeared to be no substitute for food provisioning, as eventual failures were common where advertising was frequent and provisioning rates were low. The male did not appear to compensate by hunting more when ptarmigan were scarce [long dash] his presence at the site varied little between years. It is likely that the risk of losing his territory was much higher when he was absent, with obvious long-term impli- cations. Courtship feeding likely serves three principal functions [long dash] it allows the pair to refrain from the high cost of reproduction when success is unlikely, it provides criteria on which the female can discriminate among males and nesting territories, and it strengthens the pair bond and so enhances future breeding efforts. Aborting the reproductive effort early when failure is likely may improve the ability of pairs to over-winter and retain nesting territories, and so contribute to long-term reproductive success.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We tested this by investigating how predators of goose eggs responded to lemming abundance on the Kent Peninsula, Nunavut, Canada, where nest success of white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons frontalis) and Canada geese (Branta canadensis hutchinsii) fluctuates widely. The main predators of both goose eggs and lemmings are arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus), glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), and parasitic jaegers (Stercorarius parasiticus). Foxes responded functionally to lemming density: in prime goose-nesting areas they spent less time foraging during the peak lemming year than during the increase, and were seen foraging in prime nesting areas less often during the peak than during the decline. However, numbers of fox sightings in the study area during the nesting period did not differ significantly among years. The total response (functional x numerical) of gulls was lowest at the lemming peak and highest during the increase. The total response of parasitic jaegers did not vary significantly among years. Hence, we predicted that the number of nests lost to all predators combined should be lowest at the peak and possibly highest during the increase. During the 3 years of this study, loss of Canada goose nests was lowest at the peak but highest during the decline, and annual losses of white-fronted goose nests varied little. In cycles prior to this study, nest loss was high in declines but not particularly low during peaks.

To test how overall size predicts gape, we quantified the scaling relationships between maximal gape, overall size, and several cranial dimensions for a wide range of sizes (mass 8-64,100 g) for two large, invasive snake species: Burmese pythons (Python molorus bivittatus) and brown treesnakes (Boiga irregularis). Although skull size scaled with negative allometry relative to overall size, isometry and positive allometry commonly occurred for other measurements. For similar snout-vent lengths (SVL), the maximal gape areas of Burmese pythons were approximately 4-6 times greater than those of brown treesnakes, mainly as a result of having a significantly larger relative contribution to gape by the intermandibular soft tissues (43% vs. 17%). In both snake species and for all types of prey, the scaling relationships predicted that relative prey mass (RPM) at maximal gape decreased precipitously with increased overall snake size. For a given SVL or mass, the predicted maximal values of RPM of the Burmese pythons exceeded those of brown treesnakes for all prey types, and predicted values of RPM were usually least for chickens, greatest for limbed reptiles and intermediate for mammals. The pythons we studied are noteworthy for having large overall size and gape that is large even after correcting for overall size, both of which could facilitate some large individuals (SVL = 5 m) exploiting very large vertebrate prey (e.g., deer > 50 kg). Although brown treesnakes had longer quadrate bones, Burmese pythons had larger absolute and larger relative gape as a combined result of larger overall size, larger relative head size, and most importantly, greater stretch of the soft tissues.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Spatially-explicit bioenergetics models that estimate the amount of prey consumed by predators are required to inform such policy. These models require information on the number of predators in a population, their nutritional demands, their diet composition and their seasonal distribution in the marine environment. This paper reviews all published information on the diet and at-sea distribution of the six penguin species that breed in the CAMLR Convention Area, the methods used to collect these data and the uncertainties inherent in them. The review will be of utility to modellers as a source of parameters, and to penguin biologists by providing comparative information for their own findings and by highlighting significant gaps in existing knowledge and methods that could be used to fill these.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Age-intensity data for birds of known age suggest that the rate of parasite uptake increase during the first 6 mo of a birds's life and this increase reflects an increase in feeding rate with age and exhibits no signs of self-cure. Analysis of these age-intensity curves permits us to estimate the transmission rate of the free-living infective stages. Reinfection rates of adults treated to reduce parasite intensities were not significantly different from infection rates of naive immature grouse. Secondary infections continued to rise over a period of 18 mo and this suggests that there is no strong host-mediated response against the parasite. Any density-dependent reduction in parasite fecundity is probably very weak and would act through interspecific competition between parasites. Initial analysis of worm egg production in relation to the intensity of worm infection found weak evidence of density-dependent suppression of egg production at high worm intensities. However, a more rigorous analysis found that such a relationship suffered from Type I errors and was a consequence of the aggregated distribution of the parasites. Any density-dependent suppression of parasite egg production is too weak to be detected and would only occur at high worm intensities. The potential density-dependent reductions in fecundity on the population dynamics of T. tenuis and red grouse are examined using a mathematical model. The model suggests that the presence of density-dependent reductions in worm fecundity could produce significant reductions in the propensity of the grouse-nematode system to exhibit population cycles.",10.2307/3284438,,JME,Phasianidae,No,,No,parasite transmission,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An alternative hypothesis is developed from considerations of body size and biogeographic effects on productivity. This suggests that the northern limit of the red fox's geographic range is determined directly by resource availability (and thus ultimately by climate), whereas the southern limit of the arctic fox's range is determined, through interspecific competition, by the distribution and abundance of the red fox. Predictions from this hypothesis are fulfilled, particularly by data on fur harvests.

A total of 176 prey individuals were identified from remains found under goshawk nests and prey-plucking posts. Birds represented the dominant component of diets (70.5%) with a lower contribution from mammals (29.5%). Overall, Connecticut goshawk diets were dominated by sciurids and Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus). Productivity calculated from 15 known nesting attempts totaled 32 young for an average of 2.13 young per nesting attempt (range 1-4 young). Goshawks nested in large tracts of mature forests with high levels of canopy cover (82%). The nest site topography was consistent with previous studies finding that goshawks avoid southern slopes. Tree densities in the larger size classes and basal area were characteristic for mature forest. Goshawks constructed their nests in large diameter trees, Which averaged 41.7 cm in diameter at breast height. Patch size of contiguous forests surrounding goshawk nests revealed a very high mean of 324.5 ha, thus suggesting that large forest patch size may be important for nesting by this forest interior species. Analysis of 202 ha circles centered on each nest revealed that total forest cover averaged 156.1 ha, which was comprised of 65.2 ha for conifer forest, 75.6 ha for deciduous forest, and 17.4 ha for mixed forest. Overall, the post- fledgling family areas for these nests were dominated by forest cover (>75%). Our results suggest that goshawks usually prefer isolation and little human disturbance at the nest site, but some exceptions were noted. Given the highly fragmented and urbanized landscape of Connecticut, we suggest that goshawk management should focus on providing large tracts of mature forest at least 300 ha in extent.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But predicting the impacts of invasive species is daunting, particularly in large systems threatened by multiple invasive species, such as North America's Laurentian Great Lakes. We developed and evaluated a scenario-building process that relied on an expert panel to assess possible future impacts of aquatic invasive species on recreational fishing in the Great Lakes. To maximize its usefulness to policy makers, this process was designed to be implemented relatively rapidly and considered a range of species. The expert panel developed plausible, internally consistent invasion scenarios for five aquatic invasive species, along with subjective probabilities of those scenarios. We describe these scenarios and evaluate this approach for assessing future invasive species impacts. The panel held diverse opinions about the likelihood of the scenarios, and only one scenario with impacts on sport fish species was considered likely by most of the experts. These outcomes are consistent with the literature on scenario building, which advocates for developing a range of plausible scenarios in decision-making because the uncertainty of future conditions makes the likelihood of any particular scenario low. We believe that this scenario-building approach could contribute to policy decisions about whether and how to address the possible impacts of invasive species. In this case, scenarios could allow policy makers to narrow the range of possible impacts on Great Lakes fisheries they consider and help set a research agenda for further refining invasive species predictions.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, there is limited information on the effects of fipronil exposure in Japanese quail. Therefore, our aim was to assess the reproductive toxicological effects of fipronil in the Japanese quail in a 15-day gavage study and then its recovery over a period of 60 days. Fipronil-administration led to significant losses in both feed intake and body weight. Whereas, the gonadosomatic index was not affected, and histological changes observed in the testes were reversible, particularly by day 45 and day 60 of recovery. Cloacal gland atrophy, reduced foam quantity and a reduction in fertility, sexual and aggressive behaviors, and serum testosterone with elevated estradiol (E2) hormone levels were also observed. All these changes gradually reversed during various recovery periods. Further, alterations in hepatic vitellogenin (Vtg) and estrogen receptor [alpha] (ER[alpha]) gene expression, assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, were also observed. Specifically, ER[alpha]1 was induced after fipronil administration, while the Vtg transcript was elevated during both exposure and recovery periods. Our results showed that fipronil exposure has a profound negative influence on reproductive traits in the male Japanese quail and exhibits an estrogenic activity that can raise the incidence of infertility in males. Nevertheless, most of the changes could be reversed after a recovery period of 30-45 days. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

From 1990 onwards a large-scale increase of predation by mammalian predators (Camivora) might have become a threat for some populations. Several studies, using a variety of methods, showed the importance of mammalian predators, while evidence for alternative explanations for breeding losses is poor. Predation was found especially in grouse, pheasant and wader species and the Great Bustard Otis tarda. Songbirds and colonial waterbirds usually did not suffer from predation, waterfowl were poorly investigated. Rabies vaccination in foxes and changes in vole abundance have possibly influenced predation levels, but the underlying process is not completely understood. This is also true for the role of food availability for adult birds.

Three prey species, rock ptarmigan (Lagopus mutus), arctic ground squirrel (Spermophilus parryii), and arctic hare (Lepus arcticus), composed 96.5% of total prey biomass identified. Ptarmigan and hares were taken in May and June of all years (98.2% of biomass). Juvenile squirrels were used extensively in July and August of 1984 and 1985 but not in 1986, when squirrel production fell to almost zero; ptarmigan continued to be the dominant prey species throughout that summer. Because densities of breeding ptarmigan remained relatively constant during the study, but those of juvenile ground squirrels did not, it appeared that gyrfalcons responded functionally to varying availability of prey. Mean weight (250 g) of prey taken by male gyrfalcons was significantly less than the weight (330 g) of prey taken by females. As predicted by optimal foraging theory, average size of prey brought to the nest increased as time away from the nest increased. Conditions of food abundance were observed at most nests, suggesting that the amount of food available during the nestling period was not limiting production. We suggest that annual production is a function of spacing of pairs, which is set during courtship and prelaying, when prey availability is at its yearly low and when males must forage for both members of the pair. The fact that most gyrfalcon pairs initiated laying only after the spring arrival of migrating ptarmigan is consistent with this conclusion.",10.1139/z88-050,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, rates of intake for wild boars were among the highest for pods of honey mesquites and acorns of live oaks. Wild boars had low rates of intake for acorns of Shumard oaks, primarily because wild boars removed the shell, which increased handling till-le and reduced size of, bite. Collared peccaries and raccoons also exhibited shelling behavior when consuming acorns, which reduced their intakes as well. White-tailed (deer had relatively high rates of intake of mast compared to other species.

Later discovered in tidal freshwater of the Potomac River, the species has become successfully established in many Maryland rivers. The magnitude of impact on preferred prey of Northern Snakehead in North American ecosystems has not been widely studied, leaving unresolved whether there are deleterious effects owed to introduction. To add insight into potential impacts of Northern Snakeheads, we calibrated a published, temperature-dependent maximum consumption model using field data and informed its results with diet and prey preference data to compare consumption levels among prey species. The total annual maximum consumption estimated from the model for a population of 600 Northern Snakeheads, which is an abundance approximated from published population sizes in streams of the Potomac basin, amounted to consumption of 2,189 kg of fish for the population per year. We found no evidence of strong prey preferences and partitioned this consumption to relative proportions of some fishes preyed on by Northern Snakehead as 661 kg/year of sunfishes Lepomis spp., 522 kg/year of Yellow Perch Perca flavescens, 332 kg/year of Goldfish Carassius auratus, 250 kg/year of White Perch Morone americana, and 174 kg/year of Banded Killifish Fundulus diaphanus. Some of these coastal fishes comprise important recreational and commercial fisheries. The maximum consumption estimates modeled here are greater than would be observed naturally, and whether predation affects persistence of the prey species in the ecosystem will depend upon the resiliency of the prey population and its current population size, which are unknown.

Observations of reproductive biology in particular their diet. Between 1st April and 1st October 2012 a pair of Short-toed Eagles successfully fledged a chick in the Haut-Valais (Swiss Alps). This event had been long awaited and was the first proven reproduction in the country following increases in the number of sightings in the 1990's. Following a rapid period of nest building incubation lasted 47 days from 13 April and the chick hatched on 29 May. The chick remained 79 days in the nest and fledged on 17 August. From the moment of fledging at least 42 days remained before total emancipation. The breeding success was certainly dependent on the availability of the Asp Viper Vipera aspis and made up 83% of prey items. The Asp Viper is the most common ophidian in Switzerland and covers a wide range of altitudes; this species is locally abundant in the Valais. This choice is rare amongst Short-toed Eagles which normally tend to prefer the large grass snakes of which only the Aesculapian Snake Elaphe longissima is present in the Valais. The Asp Viper rarely exceeds much over 70 cm in length which resulted in this pair having to compensate by twice as many feedings compared with pairs in the South of France. As many as 8 daily feedings were observed towards the end of the period that the chick was in the nest, often until late in the evening, compared with 5 in the South of France. Reptiles, (Slowworm Anguis fragilis, Grass Snake Natrix natrix, Aesculapian Snake, Smooth Snake Coronella austriaca, and Asp Viper) made up 97% of 112 prey items, the remaining 3% being made up of a Common Frog Rana temporaria, a Rock Ptarmigan chick Lagopus muta, and a Hazel Grouse chick Bonasa bonasia, it is the first time that these last two species have been reported as prey items of the Short-toed Eagle. The outstanding quality of the male played an essential part in the reproductive success (high participation in the incubation, feeding the female on the nest while two thirds of all the feedings of the chick at the nest were carried out by the male who also continued to feed it for another 42 days after fledging). This male had also been reported in the area every summer since at least 2008 and possibly already in 2007 where it had been seen hunting in the burnt Bannwald forest above Loeche that had burnt in 2003.

Identifying species susceptibility to warming is relevant in assessing risks to animal populations and ecological processes. The progressive increase in ambient temperature as a result of global warming might have an effect on the timing of primary moult. This could affect a bird's annual cycle, influencing reproductive success and population dynamics. We describe a method to examine the potential effects of global warming on the primary moult process in a sedentary population of Red-legged Partridges (Alectoris rufa). We organised the factors that might influence the timing of moult end into a network and distinguished between environmental and intrinsic factors. We sorted the factors according to their contribution to quantitative moult models and constructed a diagrammatic scheme showing their interactions and effect on the end of primary moult over the annual cycle. In Red-legged Partridges, the timing of the end of moult varies according to age-sex class. We found no timing differences by age, but found significant timing differences by adult sex. More females overlap their moult with juveniles than males because female parental effort is higher, more females incubate and brood chicks. The timing of the end of moult varies by year due to conspecific interactions that change according to influences of the weather, habitat, and social and flock conditions. Parent birds synchronize their primary moult with the chick's growth, degree of cover and food resources. From the time of hatching to the following year, the date (day-length), social factors (conspecific interactions), and weather (resources) affect the timing of moult and the birds' annual cycle. Global warming affects the timing of the end of moult and that of the annual cycle. If the extent of the breeding period is shortened, there could be a negative effect on population outcomes. Middle size prey species are key in trophic chains. Our results suggest that the timing of the end of moult could be used as a proxy measure of warming impacts on wildlife and ecosystems and also as a tool for the management of game birds.",NA,,JME,Phasianidae,,,No,climate; moult,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

DEE was at a maximum during late chick-rearing but was equally high during all other active phases of the breeding season. DEE was approximately 4xresting metabolic rate, which accords with established theory and suggests a common 'energetic ceiling' throughout the summer period. However, whether this represents a maximum in physiological capacity, or a rate which optimises fitness is still unclear. Rates of prey consumption and foraging success followed different patterns from daily energy expenditure. Daily prey consumption was high as the penguins prepared for long fasts associated with moulting and incubation but relatively low during chick-rearing, when foraging areas were restricted and foraging success lower.

Pole configuration was the most frequently identified electrocution risk factor and electrocution incidents were most often associated with distribution level (<69kV) equipment poles. Age was the second most frequently identified risk factor, with juvenile eagles electrocuted at approximately twice the rate of subadults or adults. Risk was also associated with large body size, high-quality habitat, high prey density, winter dispersal, inclement weather, and intraspecific interactions. Risk modeling based on these factors may assist electric utilities and other stakeholders in identification of high-risk poles at the regional scale. High-risk poles need prioritization for retrofitting by electric utilities. Compensatory mitigation funding becoming available through eagle take permitting may be useful in offsetting costs to utilities. Electrocution mitigation efforts strategized by region to target high-risk poles could result in substantial reductions of golden eagle annual mortalities. [copyright] 2018 The Wildlife Society.

However, the nature and consequences of changes in krill population dynamics that accompany fluctuations in its abundance are essentially unknown. A conceptual model, developed from quantitative measures of krill length in the diet of predators at South Georgia from 1991 to 1997, allowed predictions to be made about the abundance and population structure of krill in 1998 and the consequences for predators. Consistent with model predictions, in 1998 there was a serial change in krill population structure, low krill biomass and low reproductive performance of predators. The change in the modal size of krill, from 56 mm in December to 42 mm in March, was apparently a result of the transport of krill into the region. This is the first occasion when the future status and structure of the krill population at South Georgia has been successfully predicted. By representing local krill population dynamics, which may also reflect large-scale physical and biological processes, predators have a potential key role as indicators of environmental variation in the Southern Ocean at a range of spatial scales.",10.1007/s002270050665,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(karlf@imv.uit.no)",2004,Threats of the reds: can arctic foxes in Norway survive the red fox?,Fauna (Oslo),56,4,"The arctic fox Alopex lagopus in Fennoscandia is threatened with extinction, and the red fox Vulpes vulpes is believed to be a major problem. Competition between different species is difficult to Trove', unambiguously, but the two foxes are very similar in size and behaviour and inhabit the same mountainous habitat. The arctic fox is about 70% the size of the red fox (62-70 % in body mass and 80-83 % in body length), and are both killed and chased off by red foxes. Interactions are short-lasting and difficult to observe in nature, but still a number of observations have been made in Scandinavia. In only one event was a red fox chased away by an arctic fox; in all other cases the red fox was the dominant part. This result was confirmed by the few experiments that have been made with captive foxes. The evidence of interference competition is also growing, with red foxes taking over arctic fox dens at all but the highest altitudes. Today, arctic foxes apparently try to keep as long a distance to the red fox as possible, implying that they are mostly restricted to dens at the highest, and most barren, altitudes. This also reduces the arctic fix' food supply, further enhancing the problem. This paper reviews the evidence of competition between the two species, and concludes that the red fox is likely to have a great impact on the arctic fox population in Norway. A reduced food supply may also be of significance. If the trend continues, it may very well lead to the extermination of the arctic fix in Norway. Management actions should primarily try to reduce the red fox population in the presently most important arctic fox regions, and to increase the arctic fox food supply.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1525,"Bijlsma, Rob G. (rob.bijlsma@planet.nl)",2005,Trends and breeding performance of raptors in The Netherlands in 2004,Takkeling,13,1,"Over 3600 nest cards of raptors were submitted in 2004 (Appendix I), covering 10 species. The weather in 2004 was on average warm, but rather wet (especially in June-July), the summer index being 67.8 (a warm summer, based on temperatures in May-August). The frost index of the preceding winter was 7.8 (mild winter, based on temperatures in November-March 2003/2004). Common voles Microtus arm/is on average were recovering from a low in 2003 (Fig. I), but numbers were still poor in some regions: wood mouse Apodemus sylvaticus numbers were improving as well (Fig. 2). Rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus were still well below numbers in the early 1990s (i.e. before the outbreak of Rabbit Viral Haemorrhagic Disease; Bijlsma 2004a), with some encouraging signs of recovery. Bird numbers probably did not change much as compared with the past few years. Social hymenoptera had an average year (index 3 on a scale of 1-5), with a slow start in May (prospecting queens encountered adverse weather conditions) and an early demise of states during late July (Vespula germanica) and in the course of August (V. vulgaris). The slightly improved prey base, as compared with 2003, was reflected in higher numbers of nestling raptors ringed (Table I). European Honey-buzzard Pernis apivorus: clutch size was 2x 1 and 24x 2, brood size 14x 1 and 20x 2. Mean onset of laying was 29 May, however with a very large interval between first laying (12 May, never before clutch initiation in The Netherlands was found to be earlier than 15 May, Fig. 3) and last laying (19 June). Normally, pairs start breeding synchronously within a period of 10-20 days. In 2004, the last two starters may have been repeat layings as the interval between them and the rest amounted to 12 and 14 days. Interestingly, laying in the period 1997-2004 (n=193) was consistently earlier than during 1971-2004 (n=236, mostly before collected 1990). This was visible in start, peak and termination of laying (Fig. 3), presumably an effect of climate change. Of 36 nests checked, 24 were built by Honey-buzzards, 5 by Buzzards, 3 by Goshawks, 3 by Carrion Crows and I by Sparrowhawk. Failures were mostly due to predation of nestlings (3x) and/or parents (3x), mainly by Goshawks. Eurasian Marsh Harrier Circus aeruginosus: mean onset of laying was 22 April (SD=9.70, n=93, range 5 April-18 May; Appendix 2, Table 3). Clutch size averaged 4.46 (n=99, SD=1.02; Appendix 3), mean number of fledglings/successful pair 3.04 (n=103, SD-1.20; Appendix 4). Presumably, local variations in breeding parameters were mainly caused by variations in food supply (notably common voles, an important prey species; Table 5). All surviving nestlings in 74 nests were sexed, showing an almost equal sex ratio with 49.8% males (Table 4). Over the years, a biased sex ratio has been prevalent (Table 4: 52.5% males in 771 nests with 2522 nestlings). Apart from common voles, also rabbits and pheasant chicks were particularly important as prey species (Table 5), but biased sampling (mostly late nestling stage) may have under- or overestimated the relative importance of these and other prey species. Hen Harrier Circus cyaneus: the steady decline of the Dutch population resulted in the initiation of a special study into their breeding and feeding ecology on the Wadden Sea Island in 2004, the only region where the species is still surviving in some numbers (between 60 and 80 pairs). The data are summarised for the three most important islands, i.e. Texel, Terschelling and Ameland (Table 6). On average, laying started on 2 May (range 21 April-I4 May, Appendix 2). Mean clutch size was 4.7 eggs (SD=1.0, n=31; Appendix 3), mean number of fledglings/successful pair 2.4 (SD=1.3, n=28; Appendix 4). On Texel and Terschelling, many eggs did not hatch. The sex ratio on 29 nests was 37 males and 30 females. On Ameland two males were polygynous: one male attended two females (resp. 3 and 2 chicks fledging), another three females (resp. 5, 5 and 1 chicks). Individual recognition of males was based on plumage characteristics (Fig. 4) in combination with behaviour and other typical features (carrying a ring or not, on which leg). On Texel, at least 4 out of 16 males were bigamous. Many breeding birds on the Wadden Sea Islands carry a ring. Ten out of eleven recoveries of nestling-ringed Hen Harriers on Texel turned out to have returned to within 2 km of their natal site, indicating poor dispersive qualities. This may be one of the bottlenecks experienced by Hen Harriers breeding on the Wadden Sea Islands: a closed population (little exchange with other populations) with poor reproductive output. The latter is probably linked with declining food supply (rabbits and pheasants, both important prey species, have declined precipitously). The impact of local increases in the numbers of Marsh Harrier, Common Buzzard and Northern Goshawk on Hen Harriers is not yet known, but may be another factor negatively influencing Hen Harriers. Montagu's Harrier Circus pygargus: 39 pairs were recorded for The Netherlands, of which the majority nested in the province of Groningen (29), raising 85 fledglings. Breeding is still clustered in few regions. A detailed account is given by Koks et al. elsewhere in this Takkeling. See also: www.grauwekiekendief.nl. Northern Goshawk Accipiter gentilis: with the colonisation of Ameland in 2004 (one pair, both immature birds, 1 fledgling), the colonisation of the Wadden Sea Islands - started in 1997 on Texel - is now completed (Table 7). A similar process is taking place in Zeeland (southwestern Netherlands), till recently without breeding Goshawks. The average start of laying was 2 April (SD=7.84, n=277, range 13 March-28 April; Appendix 2), with clear regional variations (Table 9). On average, breeding started earlier in the southern provinces, and later in recently colonised regions and in the north. On average, mean clutch size was 3.30 (SD=0.75, n=242; Appendix 3), mean number of fledglings/successful pair 2.78 (SD=0.78, n=341; Appendix 4). Among 277 nests, sex ratio at ringing was in favour of males (54.6%; Table 10) Among 39 identified nest failures, 23 were deliberately caused by humans. Local declines since at least the early 1990s stabilised at a lower density in recent years. In the well-studied population of western Drenthe (Table 8), 2004 showed by far the poorest breeding performance since 1990, with completed clutches as small as I (2x) and 2 eggs (5x), and a reproductive output of 6 fledglings by 10 egg-laying pairs. This trend is caused by a serious decline in food supply, and - among many other impacts - results in an increasing predation pressure on other raptor species. Elsewhere in The Netherlands, prey collection in the breeding season showed that in most areas few prey species are responsible for the majority of prey consumed (Appendix 9), i.e. pigeons, corvids and starlings, indicating better feeding conditions. Sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus: mean onset of laying was 2 May (19 April-23 May, SD=6.98, n=183; Appendix 2), with distinct regional variations (Table I1). Mean clutch size was 4.47 (SD=4.86, n=I52, Appendix 3), mean number of fledglings/successful pair 3.97 (SD=1.22, n=23I, Appendix 4). The secondary sex ratio was male-biased (Table 12: 345 males, 315 females, 167 nests). Common Buzzard Buteo buteo: on average, egg laying started on 6 April (SD=7.47, n=675; Appendix 2). Clutch size averaged 2.50 eggs (SD=0.66, n=447; Appendix 3), brood size 2.02 fledglings/successful pair (including 2 with 5 and 1 with 6 chicks, the latter presumably by two females; SD=0.78, n=840; Appendix 4). This was slightly better than during the vole-crash in 2003, and was recorded in most regions except a few on sandy soil in the central and northern Netherlands (Table 13). Secondary sex ratio was female-biased: 188 males and 219 females on 266 nests (Table 14). Among prey remains found on nests, 52 species of bird, 17 species of mammals, 5 species of reptiles, 4 species of amphibians and 4 species of fish were recorded. Important prey species were voles (mainly common vole), moles, rabbits (locally only) and hares, starlings, corvids, thrushes, pigeons and pheasants (locally) (Appendix 10). Stints of adverse weather in June and July caused high mortality among nestlings, and negatively impacted the condition of surviving chicks (example in Fig. 5). Osprey Pandion haliaetus: summering Ospreys were recorded in the Oostvaar- dersplassen, Randmeren and in the southwestern Netherlands, sometimes accompanied with short bouts of nest-building. However, active nests were not recorded, despite specific searches in potential breeding areas. Eurasian Kestrel Falco tinnunculus: onset of laying averaged 18 April, with a wide variation from 25 March through 22 June (SD=12.16, n=407; Appendix 2) and between regions (Table 15). Mean clutch size was 4.91 (SD=5.50, n=491; Appendix 3), mean number of fledglings/successful nest 4.70 (SD=4.70, n=570, Appendix 4). Most Kestrels recorded were breeding in nest boxes (94%), of which 92.7% fledged at least one chick. Nesting success of 21 Kestrels breeding on open nests of corvids was slightly lower (i.e. 85.7%, n=21). Eurasian Hobby Falco subbuteo: mean start of laying was 8 June (range 25 May-223 June, SD=6.27. n=40; Appendix 2). Mean clutch size was 3.00 (SD=0.58, n=12, only 3 started in May, Appendix 3), mean number of fledglings/successful nest 2.34 (SD=0.74, n=83; Appendix 4). Presently, most pairs are recorded in open farmland where many pairs nest on electricity pylons and in poplars (Table 17, see relatively high numbers in Friesland, Noord-Brabant and Limburg). Secondary sex ratio in 10 nests was in favour of females: 9 males and 14 females (sexes identified by body mass and vocalisations) (Table 18). Food remains found at nests show a preponderance of swifts, hirundines and house sparrows (Table 19). As compared with prey choice in I970s, several aspects of the feeding ecology have changed drastically. First of all, skylarks and tree sparrows are rarely caught nowadays; both were common prey species in the 1970s. Secondly, the ratio swift versus barn swallow switched from 27:73 in the I970s to 63:37 in 2004. Both changes reflect the serious declines of skylark, barn swallow and tree sparrow in Dutch farmland; densities are very low, and in many regions these species have virtually disappeared. Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrines: in 2004, the Dutch population increased again, from 17 territorial pairs in 2003 to 27 pairs in 2004 (of which 20 pairs laid eggs. Overall, 29 nestlings were raised to fledgeing (15 males and 11 females in 9 fully sexed nests; Table 20). Most nestlings were also colour-ringed. Mean onset of laying was 18 March, ranging from 2 March through 4 April. Mean clutch size was 3.3 (N=7; Table 20), mean number of fledglings/successful pair 2.9 (N=10; Table 20). Despite the ongoing increase in population size, fledgling production has been levelling off since about 2000 (Table 21), most likely a density-dependent effect. Newcomers mostly settle with in short distances of local pairs (400-1700 m), resulting in persistent territorial conflicts, delays in egg-laying and failed breeding attempts.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Being keystone species in tundra ecosystems, changed lemming dynamics may convey significant knock-on effects on trophically linked species. Here, we analyse long-term (1988-2010), community-wide monitoring data from two sites in high-arctic Greenland and document how a collapse in collared lemming cyclicity affects the population dynamics of the predator guild. Dramatic changes were observed in two highly specialized lemming predators: snowy owl and stoat. Following the lemming cycle collapse, snowy owl fledgling production declined by 98 per cent, and there was indication of a severe population decline of stoats at one site. The less specialized long-tailed skua and the generalist arctic fox were more loosely coupled to the lemming dynamics. Still, the lemming collapse had noticeable effects on their reproductive performance. Predator responses differed somewhat between sites in all species and could arise from site-specific differences in lemming dynamics, intra-guild interactions or subsidies from other resources. Nevertheless, population extinctions and community restructuring of this arctic endemic predator guild are likely if the lemming dynamics are maintained at the current non-cyclic, low-density state.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Gossypol, a secondary plant metabolite found in cotton (Gossypium spp.), is known to be toxic to a variety of animals, specifically monogastric mammals and birds. However, there are no published data regarding the effects of gossypol in northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus). Our goal was to determine whether ingestion of gossypol presents a threat to northern bobwhite survival and reproduction. We performed this study at Tarleton State University Northern Bobwhite Research Center (Stephenville, TX, USA) during March and April 2016, using the Environmental Protection Agency's 850.2100 Guideline: Avian Acute Oral Toxicity Test. We administered one-time doses of refined gossypol to northern bobwhites at 20 mg/kg, 200 mg/ kg, 262 mg/kg, 342 mg/kg, 447 mg/kg, 585 mg/kg, 765 mg/kg, and 1,000 mg/kg body weight (BW) and observed them daily throughout a 14-day period. We measured feed consumption daily and body mass weekly. Birds receiving larger doses (447-1,000 mg/kg BW) consumed less total feed postdosing (55.46 [plus or minus] 56.46 g, n = 39) and had greater, negative postdosing percent change in mass (-23.02 [plus or minus] 13.04%, n = 85) compared with control birds and those receiving lower doses (20-342 mg/kg BW). We also examined laying performance and egg quality of birds dosed with 20 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg BW (n = 30 pairs) and the growth rate and percent mortality of second-generation young produced from these pairs. There was no difference in laying performance, egg quality, the percentage of chicks that hatched, and the growth rate and percent mortality of chicks between the dosing rates. Our results suggest that gossypol can have adverse effects on feed consumption and body mass in northern bobwhites at sufficient doses; however, a one-time acute dose of gossypol up to 200 mg/kg BW does not pose any negative reproductive effects.

Flows of nutrients and energy across ecosystem boundaries have the potential to subsidize consumer populations and modify the dynamics of food webs, but how spatio-temporal variations in autochthonous and allochthonous resources affect consumers subsidization remains largely unexplored. 2. We studied spatio-temporal patterns in the allochthonous subsidization of a predator living in a relatively simple ecosystem. We worked on Bylot Island (Nunavut, Canada), where arctic foxes (Vulpes lagopus L.) feed preferentially on lemmings (Lemmus trimucronatus and Dicrostonyx groenlandicus Traill), and alternatively on colonial greater snow geese (Anser caerulescens atlanticus L.). Geese migrate annually from their wintering grounds (where they feed on farmlands and marshes) to the Canadian Arctic, thus generating a strong flow of nutrients and energy across ecosystem boundaries. 3. We examined the influence of spatial variations in availability of geese on the diet of fox cubs (2003-2005) and on fox reproductive output (1996-2005) during different phases of the lemming cycle. 4. Using stable isotope analysis and a simple statistical routine developed to analyse the outputs of a multisource mixing model (SIAR), we showed that the contribution of geese to the diet of arctic fox cubs decreased with distance fromthe goose colony. 5. The probability that a den was used for reproduction by foxes decreased with distance from the subsidized goose colony and increased with lemming abundance. When lemmings were highly abundant, the effect of distance from the colony disappeared. The goose colony thus generated a spatial patterning of reproduction probability of foxes, while the lemming cycle generated a strong temporal variation of reproduction probability of foxes. 6. This study shows how the input of energy owing to the large-scale migration of prey affects the functional and reproductive responses of an opportunistic consumer, and how this input is spatially and temporally modulated through the foraging behaviour of the consumer. Thus, perspectives of both landscape and foraging ecology are needed to fully resolve the effects of subsidies on animal demographic processes and population dynamics.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the Crimea little bittern Ixobrychus minutus (Linnaeus, 1766) nest usually on the fresh and brackish water bodies. For the first time this species was found nesting in the Kruglaya Bay, the overused recreation area in Sevastopol (Black Sea). Our investigation detected factors determining the breeding efficiency, food spectrum, behavioral responses and the duration of stay of the little bittern in the biotope exposed to high anthropogenic load. Visual observations, photography and video recording were conducted five times a week within the Kruglaya Bay. Two adult I. minutus were observed from July 3 to August 2, and three immature birds - from July 24 to September 7, 2016 in the bay head. The presence of natural shelter (reed beds) and good feeding base contributed to successful breeding of the birds. The main prey were the juveniles of grey mullet, other preys were peacock blenny Salaria pavo, ocellated wrasse Symphodus ocellatus and invertebrates. The little bitterns showed atypical for this species synanthropic behavior: having gradually adapted to the people neighborhood, they allowed the observer's presence at 4-6 m distance. In August the young birds began demonstrating territorial behavior and in September they flied beyond the bay area. The study has disclosed high adaptive potential of I. minutus to disturbing factors in atypical to this species habitats in the coastal urban area of the Black Sea. The possibility of little bitterns settling in the fragmentary natural landscape of urban areas on the Crimean coast of the Black Sea is discussed. Presumably, I. minutus can nest in the semi-aquatic growth bordering some Crimean bays including Kruglaya, Streletskaya, Kazach'ya and Sevastopol bays. The fragments of natural landscape allow preserving the biodiversity; for their protection any building activity ruinous to semi-aquatic vegetation in the coastal zone should be banned.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Depredation of nests and predation of chicks can be two of the most influential factors limiting their productivity. Prey species utilize antipredation behaviors, such as predator avoidance, to reduce the risk of predation. Birds in general balance the dual necessity of selecting cover to hide from visual and olfactory predators to enhance prospects of survival and reproductive success, which may also be achieved by selecting habitat with relatively fewer predators. We compared avian predator densities at Greater Sage-Grouse nests and brood locations with those at random locations within available sage-grouse habitat in Wyoming. This comparison allowed us to assess the species' ability to avoid avian predators during nesting and early brood rearing. During 2008-2010, we conducted 10-min point-count surveys at 218 nests, 249 brood locations from 83 broods, and 496 random locations. We found that random locations had higher densities of avian predators compared with nest and brood locations. Greater Sage-Grouse nested in areas where there were lower densities of Common Ravens (Corvus corax), Black-billed Magpies (Pica hudsonia), Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos), and hawks (Buteo spp.) compared with random locations. Additionally, they selected brood-rearing locations with lower densities of those same avian predators and of American Kestrels (Falco sparverius), compared with random locations. By selecting nest and brood-rearing locations with lower avian predator densities, Greater Sage-Grouse may reduce the risk of nest depredation and predation on eggs, chicks, and hens.

The Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), a small mammalian predator endemic to northern tundra areas, is able to exploit different resources in the context of varying tundra ecosystems. Although generally widespread, it is critically endangered in subarctic Fennoscandia, where a fading out of the characteristic lemming cycles and competition with abundant red foxes have been identified as main threats. We studied an Arctic fox population at the Erkuta Tundra Monitoring site in low Arctic Yamal (Russia) during 10 years in order to determine which resources support the breeding activity in this population. In the study area, lemmings have been rare during the last 15 years and red foxes are nearly absent, creating an interesting contrast to the situation in Fennoscandia. Results: Arctic fox was breeding in nine of the 10 years of the study. The number of active dens was on average 2.6 (range 0-6) per 100 km2 and increased with small rodent abundance. It was also higher after winters with many reindeer carcasses, which occurred when mortality was unusually high due to icy pastures following rain-on-snow events. Average litter size was 5.2 (SD = 2.1). Scat dissection suggested that small rodents (mostly Microtus spp.) were the most important prey category. Prey remains observed at dens show that birds, notably waterfowl, were also an important resource in summer. Conclusions: The Arctic fox in southern Yamal, which is part of a species-rich low Arctic food web, seems at present able to cope with a state shift of the small rodent community from high amplitude cyclicity with lemming dominated peaks, to a vole community with low amplitude fluctuations. The estimated breeding parameters characterized the population as intermediate between the lemming fox and the coastal fox ecotype.

This finding is supplemented with certain observations of birds on the peninsula, and information on the reproduction biology of lemmings and arctic fox. Since the breeding success of several bird species nesting on the Siberian tundra are much affected by the population interactions of lemmings and arctic tox, base-line data on these mammals are needed for proper evaluation of avian records, including those from southern migration and wintering areas.

Volume I.",NA,NA,"Impacts of climate change are amplified at high latitudes such as the Arctic Coastal Plain of Alaska. In addition, this region and adjacent offshore areas are experiencing rapid changes associated with oil and gas exploration and production. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's location in northeast Alaska makes it particularly vulnerable to these environmental perturbations. Recognizing this, we have implemented several collaborative investigations of at-risk bird popu- lations and habitats since 2002. In this paper we focus on studies of shorebirds using tundra and coastal habitats. Objectives include: (1) identify important habitats for nesting and staging; (2) assess effects of development on nest predation and success rates; (3) examine post-breeding shorebird staging ecology; and (4) develop models using demographic and environmental data to evaluate causes of shorebird population declines. Evaluating impacts of changing environmental conditions on birds is an overarching objective of all studies. Initial results suggest that the impacts of development on nest success are small relative to natural variability, but could be important as additive stressors. We identified several high-use areas for post-breeding shorebirds, but also found considerable inter-annual and within-season variability in bird distribution. We are currently investigating factors associated with shorebird use of coastal habitats including availability of food resources. We recently initiated further studies on demographics of breeding shorebirds. Sev- eral years of data from multiple sites will be required to evaluate shorebird population dynamics in this highly variable and rapidly changing environment. Our studies will contribute to under- standing population limitation and developing conservation actions for arctic shorebirds.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Two large colonies, at Bullard Beach and Kildalkey Bay, account for about 85% of the overall population. At both these colonies, the area occupied by breeders showed no trend between 1983/84 and 2002/03, but the mean density of nests decreased.

At Marion Island, macaroni penguins usually breed for the first time when aged about three years. From 1994/95 to 2002/03, pairs fledged an average of 0.46 chicks per year, a number considered insufficient to maintain the population. However, during that period there was a significant increase in reproductive success with time. In the same period, the masses of males and females on arrival at breeding colonies were significantly correlated. Both showed a marked decrease in 1998/99, after the El Nino of 1997/98.

Whereas habitat loss and/or intensified agriculture have been implicated as two potential causal mechanisms for these declines, few studies have directly compared bobwhite demographics between agricultural and managed bobwhite plantation landscapes. Therefore, we monitored northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; hereafter, bobwhite) via radiotransmitters (N = 472) on a center-pivot irrigated agricultural landscape (N = 154) and an adjacent, intensively-managed bobwhite plantation (N = 318) to evaluate differences in home range, habitat use, survival, and nest survival between these two landscapes. Winter covey home ranges were larger during fall-winter 1998-99 on the agriculture site (P < 0.001). Coveys on the agricultural landscape used young planted pines (Pinus spp.) greater than expected (P < 0.05) during both years. Annual survival did not differ between sites during 1997-98 (P = 0.199) but was lower on the agriculture site (0.081, SE = 0.04) than the plantation (0.297, SE = 0.05) during 1998-99 (P < 0.001). Daily nest survival was lower on the agriculture site (0.939, SE = 0.02) than the plantation (0.979, SE = 0.01) during the 1998 nesting season (P = 0.030) but not during 1997 (P = 0.782). We surmised that large home ranges, low over-winter survival, and low nest survival observed on the agriculture site was related to poor habitat conditions and subsequent limited food resources. Thus, when agricultural landowner objectives are to benefit bobwhite, management endeavors should focus on augmenting habitat in agricultural fields, particularly during fall and winter, and, improving existing habitats (e.g., dry corners, young planted pines).",NA,,JME,No,,,No,Odontophoridae,landscape/home range,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Domestic pigeons were the most important prey at all eyries and in all habitats. Because of the importance of pigeons and because most peregrines hunted over a range of habitats, diet differences between habitats were minor. The large hunting ranges of peregrines and the high proportion of transient birds in their diet has minimized the effects on them of recent afforestation of upland areas. Males probably hunted the same prey-weight range as females; very large items were rarely taken by either sex.

The sequence of digestive processes in their gastrointestinal tract, however, is still unexplored. Using two groups of four ostriches (mean body mass 75.1 [plus or minus] 173 kg) kept on fresh alfalfa, we tested the effect of two intake levels (17 and 42 g dry matter kg-0.75 d-1) on the mean retention time (MRT) of a solute and three different-sized (2, 10, 20 mm) particle markers, mean faecal particle size (MPS), and digestibility. Intake level did not affect MRT, but MPS (0.74 vs. 1.52 mm) and dry matter digestibility (81 vs. 78%). The solute marker (MRT 22-26 h) was excreted faster than the particle markers; there was no difference in the MRT of 10 and 20 mm particles (MRT 28-32 h), but 2 mm particles were retained longer (MRT 39-40 h). Because the solute marker was not selectively retained, and wet-sieving of gut contents of slaughtered animals did not indicate smaller particles in the caeca, the long MRT of small particles is interpreted as intermittent excretion from the gizzard, potentially due to entrapment in small grit The marker excretion pattern also showed intermittent peaks for all markers in five of the animals, which indicates non-continuous outflow from the gizzard. When adding our data to literature data on avian herbivores, a dichotomy is evident, with ostrich and hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin) displaying long MRTs, high digestibilities, and gut capacities similar to mammalian herbivores, and other avian herbivores such as grouse, geese or emus with shorter MRTs, lower fibre digestibilities and lower gut capacities. In the available data for all avian herbivores where food intake and MRTs were measured, this dichotomy and food intake level, but not body mass, was related to MRT, adding to the evidence that body mass itself may not be sole major determinant of digestive physiology. The most striking difference between mammalian and avian herbivores from the literature is the fundamentally lower methane production measured in the very few studies in birds including ostriches, which appears to be at the level of reptiles, in spite of general food intake levels of a magnitude as in mammals. Further studies in ostriches and other avian herbivores are required to understand the differences in digestive mechanisms between avian and mammalian herbivores. [copyright]2012 Elsevier Inc.

In the field test, northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) chicks were cross-fostered to bantam chicken (Gallus domesticus) hens. Then, 12-d-old broods in enclosed alfalfa fields were exposed to sprayed azinphos-methyl (Guthion 2S) at three application rates (0 (control), 0.77, and 3.11 kg active ingredient/ha).

Analysis and identification of food remains in scats is an important method often employed for these objectives. Proportions of consumed biomass estimated from scat samples may provide an accurate approximation of the actual diet when correction factors (CFs) are used. The red fox Vulpes vulpes is a widespread generalist carnivore that includes a wide range of foods in its diet, including livestock and plays a potential role as wildlife predator. We performed controlled feeding trials with red foxes to derive CFs for eight food categories, including both from animal and vegetal origin. CFs were calculated on a daily basis as the ratio between eaten fresh mass and total dry mass of the resulting scats. Red foxes consumed daily 615 [plus or minus] 19 g (mean [plus or minus] SE) of food and produced 6.4 [plus or minus] 0.3 scats weighing 31 [plus or minus] 1.2 g.

CF precision was low for deer, fruit and hare Lepus granatensis, but more importantly, the CFs differed considerably among food types.

Researchers have offered several hypotheses to explain the low abundance of ruffed grouse in the region, including low availability of early-successional forests due to changes in land use, additive harvest mortality, low productivity and recruitment, and nutritional stress. As part of the ACGRP, we investigated ruffed grouse population ecology. Our objectives were to estimate reproductive rates, estimate survival and cause-specific mortality rates, examine if ruffed grouse harvest in the Appalachian region is compensatory, and estimate ruffed grouse finite population growth. We trapped >3,000 ruffed grouse in autumn (Sep-Nov) and spring (Feb-Mar) from 1996 to September 2002 on 12 study areas. We determined the age and gender of each bird and fitted them with necklace-style radiotransmitters and released them at the trap site. We tracked ruffed grouse >=2 times per week using handheld radiotelemetry equipment and gathered data on reproduction, recruitment, survival, and mortality. Ruffed grouse population dynamics in the Appalachian region differed from the central portion of the species' range (i.e., northern United States and Canada). Ruffed grouse in the Appalachian region had lower productivity and recruitment, but higher survival than reported for populations in the Great Lakes region and southern Canada. Population dynamics differed between oak (Quercus spp.)-hickory (Carya spp.) and mixed-mesophytic forest associations within the southern and central Appalachian region. Productivity and recruitment were lower in oak-hickory forests, but adult survival was higher than in mixed-mesophytic forests. Furthermore, ruffed grouse productivity and recruitment were more strongly related to hard mast (i.e., acorn) production in oak-hickory forests than in mixed-mesophytic forests. The leading cause of ruffed grouse mortality was avian predation (44% of known mortalities). Harvest mortality accounted for 12% ofall known mortalities and appeared to be compensatory. Population models indicated ruffed grouse populations in the Appalachian region are declining ([lambda] = 0.7-0.95), but differences in model estimates highlighted the need for improved understanding of annual productivity and recruitment. We posit ruffed grouse in the Appalachian region exhibit a clinal population structure characterized by changes in life-history strategies. Changes in life history strategies are in response to gradual changes in forest structure, quality of food resources, snowfall and accumulation patterns, and predator communities. Management efforts should focus on creating a mosaic of forest stand ages across the landscape to intersperse habitat resources including nesting and brood cover, adult escape cover, roosting sites, and, most importantly, food resources. Land managers can intersperse habitat resources through a combination of clearcutting, shelterwood harvests, group selection, and timber stand improvement (including various thinnings and prescribed fire). Managers should maintain current ruffed grouse harvest rates while providing high quality hunting opportunities. We define high quality hunting as low hunting pressure, low vehicle traffic, and high flush rates. Managers can provide high quality hunting opportunities through use of road closures in conjunction with habitat management.",10.2193/0084-0173.168,,JME,Phasianidae,No,,No,harvest rates and predation; did not measure insect or pesticide,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With expanding urbanization, these birds are often found in exurban and suburban areas where they have access to food sources that may differ from those used by birds living in rural habitats and, as a result, also differ morphologically and physiologically. To investigate this hypothesis, we compared the morphology and nutritional physiology of quail sampled at sites varying with respect to land use and cover. We hypothesized that quail living in more developed areas have access to a greater variety of and to more stable food resources, and predicted that morphology and nutritional physiology would be associated with degree of urbanization. We sampled adult birds at locations in the greater Phoenix metropolitan, Arizona (USA) area that vary with respect to land use and cover types. At the time of capture, birds were weighed and chest circumference was recorded. We also collected a blood sample from the jugular vein of each individual for analysis of plasma glucose, total proteins, triglycerides, and free glycerol. Consistent with the hypothesis, birds living in more developed environments had larger chest circumferences and higher circulating lipid concentrations than birds living in less developed areas, suggesting greater access to lipid-rich foods. In addition, the areal proportion of grass and lakes was negatively correlated to plasma free glycerol (r = -0.46, p = .031), and positively, but not significantly, correlated to plasma protein concentrations (r = 0.388, p = .073).

In the winter quarters, long-tailed ducks mainly eat the blue mussel Mytilus edulis. We examined how North-west Siberian lemming dynamics, assumed as a proxy for predation pressure, affect long-tailed duck breeding success and how nutrient availability in the Baltic Sea influences long-tailed duck population size via mussel biomass and quality. Evidence suggests that the long-tailed duck population dynamics was predator-driven on the breeding grounds and resource-driven on the wintering grounds. Nutrients from fertilizer runoff from farmland stimulate mussel stocks and quality, supporting high long-tailed duck population sizes. The applied hierarchical analysis combining several trophic levels can be used for evaluating large-scale environmental factors that affect the population dynamics and abundance of migrants from one environment to another.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Variation in the timing of autumn migration of adult and juvenile Curlew Sandpipers was influenced by breeding success connected to predation pressure on the Arctic breeding grounds. Median migration date of adult birds was significantly later in good breeding years compared with poor breeding years while the migration of juveniles was earlier in good breeding years compared with poor breeding years. Also, adults migrated earlier when the average temperature in June was warmer. Median migration dates of adults have advanced by 23 days from 1946-2005, but the migration dates of juveniles have remained unchanged. Unchanged migration dates of juveniles indicate that earlier departure of the adult Curlew Sandpipers from the breeding grounds was not due to earlier breeding. Evidence suggests that declining breeding productivity as a result of increasing predation on broods of shorebirds might, over the years, be the reason for the observed pattern of early departure of adults from the breeding grounds. One possible consequence of earlier migration is a mismatch between timing of migration and periods of food abundance on migration routes and at the wintering grounds, leading to a decline in adult and juvenile survival and population size.

In the dog family, Canidae, variance in female prebirth investment is adjusted by litter size. The arctic fox, Alopex lagopus, is a small canid living on the northern tundras of the world. It has the largest known litter size in the order Carnivora, up to 18 young, and litter size is highly variable. We have analysed data from arctic fox populations throughout the species circumpolar range. In some areas, arctic foxes feed on strongly fluctuating populations of small rodents. In contrast, they have more stable food resources at bird cliffs and along coast lines. Food availability determines arctic fox litter and population sizes. A comparison between fluctuating and stable arctic fox populations showed that fluctuations are associated with large litter sizes. There were significant differences in litter size means, maxima and variances, as well as in placental scar count means. We have discussed five hypotheses on the determination of variation in litter size: one energetic, one genetic (based on density variation), one diet-determined, one based on reproductive allocation and one based on differences in reaction norms. Our findings suggest that litter size in the arctic fox is determined by the combined effect of immediate resource levels and the degree of resource predictability. We describe reaction norms that suggest how litter sizes result from adaptive plasticity within each of two genetic strategies where, according to the jackpot hypothesis, populations with unpredictable food resources generally have larger litter sizes. Within each genetic strategy, or reaction norm, litter sizes are adjusted through a number of plastic traits. These traits are influenced by nutritional limitations and include reduced ovulation rates, prenatal losses, and litter size reduction during the lactation period.",10.2307/3546681,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The numerical response of arctic foxes to varying densities of Lemmus had a time lag of 1 year, producing a pattern of limit cycles in lemming-arctic fox interactions. Arctic fox litter sizes showed no time lag, but a linear relation to Lemmus densities. We found no evidence for a numerical response to population density changes in Dicrostonyx. 5. The functional or dietary response of arctic foxes followed a type II curve for Lemmus, but a type III response curve for Dicrostonyx. 6.

Nests are widely used for breeding across taxa and thought to influence offspring mortality risk. Traditionally, more complex, enclosed nest structures are thought to reduce offspring predation by reducing the visibility of nest contents and muffling offspring sounds compared to open nests. Direct tests of the functional bases for nest structure influence on predation risk are lacking. We used experiments and 10 years of observational data to examine how nest structure influences nest predation risk in a diverse community of tropical songbirds. First, we examined how nest size was related to nest structure and nest predation rates across species. Second, we assessed how nest structure influences the detectability of nestling begging calls both in field and in laboratory settings. Finally, we examined how the acoustic properties of different nest structures influence nest predation risk. Specifically, we experimentally broadcast begging calls from open and enclosed nests to determine how auditory cues and nest structure interact to affect predation on plasticine and quail eggs. We also tested whether nest structure was associated with differences in nest predation rates between the incubation (no begging cues) and nestling (begging cues) stages. We found that enclosed nests are larger than open nests after accounting for adult size, and larger nests had increased predation rates. Moreover, enclosed nests did not consistently alter nestling begging calls in ways that reduce the likelihood of predation compared to open nests. Indeed, begging cues increased predation rates for enclosed but not open-cup nests in our playback experiment, and nest predation rates showed greater increases after hatching in enclosed than open-cup nests. Ultimately, enclosed nests do not necessarily provide greater predation benefits than open nests in contrast to long-standing theory.

This resulted in detection of 62 species of prey across 51 broods with Meadow pipit, Red grouse, Wren, Skylark, and voles being most frequently detected. Frequency of occurrence data and species accumulation curves reveal high incidence of Red grouse and low prey species richness in the diet of hen harriers in DGMs but low incidence of Red grouse and high prey species richness in walked-up and unmanaged moors.

Traditionally it was believed that predators take only wounded, sick, old or otherwise low-quality individuals, and thus have little impact on prey populations. However, there is increasing evidence that, at least under certain circumstances, vertebrate predators may indeed limit prey numbers. This potential role of predators as limiting factors of prey populations has created conflicts between predators and human hunters, because the hunters may see predators as competitors for the same resources. A particularly acute conflict has emerged over the past few decades between gamebird hunters and birds of prey in Europe. As a part of a European-wide research project, we reviewed literature on the relationships between birds of prey and gamebirds. We start by analysing available data on the diets of 52 European raptor and owl species. There are some 32 species, mostly specialist predators feeding on small mammals, small passerine birds or insects, which never or very rarely include game animals (e.g. hares, rabbits, gamebirds) in their diet. A second group (20 species) consists of medium-sized and large raptors which prey on game, but for which the proportion in the diet varies temporally and spatially. Only three raptor species can have rather large proportions of gamebirds in their diet, and another seven species may utilise gamebirds locally to a great extent. We point out that the percentage of a given prey species in the diet of an avian predator does not necessarily reflect the impact of that predator on densities of prey populations. Next, we summarise available data on the numerical responses of avian predators to changing gamebird numbers. In half of these studies, no numerical response was found, while in the remainder a response was detected such that either raptor density or breeding success increased with density of gamebirds. Data on the functional responses of raptors were scarce. Most studies of the interaction between raptors and gamebird populations give some estimate of the predation rate (per cent of prey population taken by predator), but less often do they evaluate the subsequent reduction in the pre-harvest population or the potential limiting effect on breeding numbers. The few existing studies indicate that, under certain conditions, raptor predation may limit gamebird populations and reduce gamebird harvests. However, the number and extent of such studies are too modest to draw firm conclusions, Furthermore, their geographical bias to northern Europe, where predator prey communities are typically simpler than in the south, precludes extrapolation to more diverse southern European ecosystems. There is an urgent need to develop further studies, particularly in southern Europe, to determine the functional and numerical responses of raptors to gamebird populations in species and environments other than those already evaluated in existing studies. Furthermore, additional field experiments are needed in which raptor and possibly also mammalian predator numbers are manipulated on a sufficiently large spatial and temporal scale. Other aspects that have been little studied are the role of predation by the non-breeding part of the raptor population, or floaters, on the breeding success and survival of gamebirds, as well as the effect of intra-guild predation. Finally there is a need for further research on practical methods to reduce raptor predation on gamebirds and thus reduce conflict between raptor conservation and gamebird management.",10.1017/S146479310400658X,,JME,No,,,No,Predator,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The model was modified to describe natural selection for such a trait in ecologically limited populations with an age structure. Simulation results are aimed at explaining the existing genetic variety in litter size in different (natural and artificial) populations of Arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus). The model assumes that the maintenance of polymorphism in litter size is associated with periodic changes in availability of food for natural populations of Arctic foxes and significantly depends on a parameter describing the relative survival advantage of individuals from small litters during years with low food supply. The work shows that selection by a sex-limited trait maintains the litter size polymorphism in a wider range of values of this parameter than selection by a trait not limited by sex, which is described by the classical selection model for the case where the survival and fecundity of an individual are determined only by its own genotype, regardless of sex. It is known that the presence of an age or stage structure in a population significantly increases the chances of maintaining genetic variety in a nonstationary environment. A generalization of the proposed selection model for a population with two stages of development made it possible to show that polymorphism in litter size is possible within even wider ranges of values of the considered parameter.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

During 1999-2006, we monitored bobwhite reproduction on 11 sites in three states across the southeastern United States. Combined, there were 37 site-year combinations when MMTR occurred and 20 combinations when it did not occur. We conducted 57 predator surveys and calculated an index of meso-mammal activity (i.e. predator index), for each site, as the average number of station visits per night by raccoons Procyon lotor, nine-banded armadillos Dasypus novemcinctus, Virginia opossums Didelphis virginiana, bobcats Lynx rufus and foxes Vulpes vulpes, Urocyon cinereoargenteus. The average predator index (predator visits per trap night) across sites was 0.13. We collected bobwhite reproductive information from a total of 3935 radio-tagged bobwhites resulting in 2499 nests. We used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the relationships between MMTR, predator activity, and bobwhite reproduction. The mean predator index for non-trapped sites was 0.21 (95% CLs: 0.18, 0.24) compared to 0.10 (95% CL: 0.07, 0.13) for trapped sites.

Change in the diet may call for changes in the hunting mode and traits determining hunting success. We explored long-term trends in sternum size and shape in the northern goshawk by applying geometric morphometrics. Tetraonids, the primary prey of the goshawk, have decreased and been replaced by smaller birds in the diet. We expected that the size of the goshawk has decreased accordingly more in males than females based on earlier observations of outer morphology. We also expected changes in sternum shape as a function of changes in hunting mode. Size of both sexes has decreased during the preceding decades (1962-2008), seemingly reflecting a shift in prey size and hunting mode. Female goshawks hunting also mammalian prey tend to have a pronouncedly ""Buteo-type"" sternum compared to males preying upon birds. Interestingly, the shrinkage of body size resulted in an increasingly ""Buteo-type"" sternum in both sexes. In addition, the sternum shape in birds that died accidentally (i.e., fit individuals) was more Buteo-type than in starved ones, hinting that selection was towards a Buteo-type sternum shape. We conclude that these observed patterns are likely due to directional selection driven by changes in the diet towards smaller and more agile prey. On the other hand, global warming is predicted to also cause a decrease in size, thus these two scenarios are inseparable. Because of difficulties in studying fitness-related phenotypic changes of large raptors in the field, time series of museum exemplars collected over a wide geographical area may give answers to this conundrum.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These actions could affect geese directly (e.g., through oil spills) or indirectly (e.g., by altering food supplies or predator populations). Studies to date indicate no changes in the distribution, abundance, or reproduction of these geese that clearly can be attributed to development; rather, their numbers and recruitment have responded in the oil fields, as elsewhere, mainly to weather and predation. When snowmelt in spring is later than usual, the birds postpone or forego nesting, with consequent diminishment in recruitment. Predation by arctic foxes (Alopex lagopus), glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus), and grizzly bears (Ursus arctos) sometimes causes substantial losses of eggs and young, and predation by ravens (Corvus corax) has also been observed. Development-related changes in weather (microclimate) and loss of feeding habitat have involved small percentages of the total areas traditionally used. and populations of the birds probably have not been affected by these changes.

This variation was present both between territories and between two larger regions with different densities of goshawks' main prey, grouse. Partial brood loss was inversely related to natural main-prey densities, but the relationship was far from straightforward: spatial nonlinearities arising from between-territorial differences influenced the results. Brood-loss patterns also differed between years and between initial clutch-size categories. Potential sex-biased post-hatching mortality was not related to grouse density and partial brood loss did not alter the original population-wide egg sex ratio.

Trends and breeding performance of raptors in The Netherlands in 2012. De Takkeling 21: 5-48. A total of 3424 nest record cards of raptors were submitted in 2012 (Appendix 1, handed in up to and including 1 January 2013), covering 10 species. For White-tailed Eagle, Red Kite, Hen Harrier and Montagu's Harrier no nest cards were submitted, but information was received from other sources. The preceding winter was normal (frost index of 19.8 on a scale of 1-100), with a severe frost period of two weeks. The summer was normal (summer index 67.3), with high temperatures in March but much wetter and cooler in April and May. Vole (Microtus arvalis and Myodes glareolus) and mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) abundance was average in the northern Netherlands, but probably much less in southern provinces. Rodent numbers declined in spring and summer. Indices of Rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus and Hare Lepus europaeus were again poor, as were bird numbers (late start, rather poor reproduction). Social wasps were present in poor numbers, with on average a late start and an early ending of colonial activities (German and Common Wasp Vespula germanica and V vulgaris, Saxon Wasp Dolichovespula saxonica). Honey Buzzard Pernis apivorus: onset of laying averaged 27 May (range 17 May-7 June), with a single peak in late May (only 4 out of 26 clutches sarted in June). Clutch size was 2x 1 and 16x 2 egg(s). Mean brood size was 13x 1 and 24x 2 chick(s). Of 51 nests recorded, eggs were laid in 43 nests, of which 14 failed. Most causes of failure involved predation. Prey remains found on nests were mainly wasp combs: 66x V vulgaris, 42x V germanica, 1x V rufa, 2x Turdus merula, 1x T. philomelos, 1x Rana temporaria and 5x Pelophylax spp. Red Kite Milvus milvus: apparently one breeding pair with one fledgling in the eastern Netherlands. Black Kite Milvus migrans: for the fourth year in succession a nesting attempt took place in the southern Netherlands (Limburg) where a single chick was successfully raised (start of egg laying 4 June). White-tailed Eagle Haliaeetus albicilla: four pairs raised 5 chicks, i.e. one in the Oostvaardersplassen (1 chick), one in Lauwersmeer (1 chick, successful for first time), one in Roggebotzand (2 chicks, ditto) and one in Biesbosch (1 chick, first attempt). Except for Roggebotzand, all nests were in nature reserves. Marsh Harrier Circus aeruginosus: mean onset of laying was 28 April (range 5 April-19 June; normal egg laying through mid-May, later pairs mostly repeat layings; Appendix 2, Table 2. Clutch size averaged 4.4 (SD=1.0, N=83, range 2-7; Appendix 3), mean number of fledglings/successful pair 2.9 (SD=1.1 N=101, Appendix 4). Many nests showed losses among chicks; remaining chicks were heavily infested with faultbars. All surviving nestlings in 74 nests were sexed: 115 males and 89 females. Over the years 1996-2011, a biased secondary sex ratio has been prevalent (Table 3: 53.0% males in 1317 nests with 4196 nestlings). Illegal nest destruction occurred in the provinces of Friesland (five nests) and Zeeland (2 nests). Food remains found on nests showed a diverse diet, with relatively high numbers of Pheasant chicks, voles, rabbits and hares, and a large variety of (fledglings of) birds and small mammals. Hen Harrier Circus cyaneus: the population continues to decline. On the Wadden Sea Islands of Schiermonnikoog and Terschelling, for the first time no nests were found (on Terschelling, still 39 pairs in 1997), as has been the case for some years already for Ameland. On Vlieland a single pair raised three chicks, and Texel had 8 pairs raising 11 chicks (poor vole year). In mainland Netherlands, 2 successful broods were found in farmland in Groningen (5 fledglings), and another two in marshland in Flevoland (1 successful). Montagu's Harrier Circus pygargus: in 2012, the Dutch population amounted to 42 pairs, raising 49 young, a significant loss compared to 2011 (63 pairs). Goshawk Accipiter gentilis: mean start of laying was 1 April (48% of 212 clutches started in March; range 15 March-28 April, Appendix 2), clutch size averaged 3.4 eggs (SD=0.8, N=175, range 1-5, including 8 C/5; Appendix 3), brood size (at fledging) 2.6 (Appendix 4, SD=0.9, N=320, range 1-5). Only 28% of C/4s fledged all chicks; in 8 C/5 only a single pair succeeded in raising 5 chicks. The latest start of laying, on average, was found in the provinces of Zuid-Holland and Zeeland, perhaps reflecting a 'young' population as both provinces were only recently colonised by Goshawks. Over the years, start of egg laying remained stable (1984-2012 in Drenthe, 1996-2012 in The Netherlands), late starts being associated with a cold March (Fig. 8). Secondary sex ratio on 212 nests was in favour of males (55.0%), which is in line with the mean for 1996-2012 (55.0% male in 4338 nests with 11,587 nestlings). Among identified causes of nest failure, illegal human activities were important (13 out of 20). Food remains found on and near nests showed a preponderance of pigeons (mostly Racing Pigeon Columba livia and Woodpigeon C. palumbus; 42.9% of 1297 prey remains; Appendix 5). Among age-identified Racing Pigeons, first-year birds (born in 2012) were poorly represented (24.5% of 87 rings found on nests and in pellets; normally upwards of 50%). Other important prey groups (in numbers) were: corvids including Jay Garrulus glandarius (15.9%), thrushes (8.2%) and Starling Sturnus vulgaris (7.7%). Raptors and owls (resp. 2.3% and 1.8%) were taken in small numbers. Sparrowhawk Accipiter nisus: mean onset of laying was 29 April (range 4 April-23 May, SD=0.9, N=136; Appendix 2); the proportion of pairs starting in April was 54%. Clutch size averaged 4.8 (SD=0.9, N=110, Appendix 3), the number of fledglings per successful pair 3.9 (SD=1.2, N=149). No clutches of 7 eggs were recorded (Appendix 4). The secondary sex ratio was slightly in favour of females (48.8% males, 373 young, 99 nests). The long-term sex ratio was 51.1% male (1996=2011: 11,954 chicks on 3140 nests). Among nest failures, predation was most often recorded: 18x among 23 cases of natural losses. Buzzard Buteo buteo: average start of egg laying was calculated at 4 April (range 10 March-16 May, SD=8.1, N=520; Appendix 2). Early starts are prbably associated with vole outbreaks. In the long run (1984-2012 in Drenthe, 1996-2012 for The Netherlands), no evidence is available that egg laying has been advancing. Mean clutch size was 2.6 (SD=0.6, N=400, with 21 C/4), mean brood size of successful pairs was 1.9 (SD=0.6, N=916; Appendix 4). Most nest failures could be attributed to deliberate disturbance by man (65 out of 103 cases). The secondary sex ratio in 212 nests was male-biased: 219 males, 164 females (as in the long run, i.e 1996-2012: 53.7% for 6658 young on 3491 nests). Food choice was varied, with 60 bird species (37.0% of all prey items), 22 mammal species (57.0% of all prey items, Moles Talpa europaea, Rabbits, Hares and Common Voles most important), and some snakes (Vipera berus, Natrix natrix), Anguis fragilis, frogs, toads and fish (Appendix 6, N=1488). Osprey Pandion haliaetus: nesting attempts were not recorded. Eurasian Kestrel Falco tinnunculus: onset of laying averaged 19 April (range 13 March-3 June, N=404; Appendix 2). Mean clutch size was 4.9 (SD=0.9, N=400; Appendix 3), mean number of fledglings/successful nest 4.1 (SD=1.3, N=524, Appendix 4). Full nest failures were common, also among users of nestboxes: 15% of 587 nest (and 57% in 7 users of crow's nests). Of 19 nest failures with known background, 3 were intentionally caused by man,the rest mainly involved predation. Prey remains in nestboxes consisted of 51 birds and 26 mammals. Hobby Falco subbuteo: mean start of laying was 10 June (range 1 June-8 July, N=28; Appendix 2). Mean clutch size was 2.6 (SD=0.7, N=9; Appendix 3), mean number of fledglings/successful nest 2.4 (SD=0.7, N=64 Appendix 4). Sex ratio in 6 nests was 5 males and 11 females. In 2012, the proportion of pairs nesting on crow's nests in electricity pylons was 36.5% (N=84 nests). Peregrine Falcon Falco peregrinus: the population is estimated at 110-125 pairs, breeding for the first time in all provinces of the country. The lay date averaged 14 March (range 3 March-4 April). Clutches were C/2 (N=1), C/3 (N=) and C/4 (N=10), brood size was on average 2.8 (SD=0.7, range 1-4, N=18). Of 36 nestlings sexed in 13 nests, 18 were male, 18 female. At five breeding sites in the SW-Netherlands, extensive prey lists were collected, consisting of 52 bird species (mostly Racing Pigeons, and high numbers of waders, thrushes and Starlings).",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here we examined the relationship between availability and selection of ants by the desert horned lizard (Phrynosoma platyrhinos Girard, 1852) to test the hypothesis that P. platyrhinos are specialist predators on harvester ants, and to investigate which factors influence the prey preference of lizards. Variation in ant availability and lizard diets was assessed using 83 plots established along a Great Basin shrub-steppe bajada in northwestern Utah, USA. Across the study site, 14 of 20 ant species were represented in the lizard diet. However, 70% of that diet consisted of just two species. In contrast to previous studies, P. platyrhinos did not show a disproportionate preference for harvester ants. Instead, larger ants of any species (including harvester ants) were preferentially selected over medium-sized and smaller ants. These findings suggest that desert horned lizards demonstrate an opportunistic feeding strategy in which lizards select ants based on their body size and abundance. More generally, these results emphasize the importance of assessing predator response across naturally varying gradients in prey availability to evaluate feeding specialization.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ad libitum food was provided in all meals. A proximate analysis of the two diets was performed and showed that cockerels when compared to mice contained more crude protein (60.0% versus 42.7% dry matter) and less fat (28.1% versus 46.5% dry matter). Body mass of nestlings was recorded daily until fledging, while lengths of the antebrachium and 9th primary remex were measured at intervals of 2 to 5 days. Data were fitted to the Richards growth model. Cockerel-fed nestlings exhibited growth patterns similar to those found in free-ranging kestrels. Mouse-fed birds however, grew more slowly which could be related to inadequate protein intake. No effect of hand-feeding frequency (4 versus 6 times daily) on growth rates was noted under any of the two diets. Irrespective of the dietary group, female kestrels were significantly heavier at the end of the experiment, as expected from the reversed sexual size dimorphism present in adult American kestrels.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1573,"Christensen, Thomas Kjaer and Elmeros, Morten and Lassen, Pia",2010,"[The occurrence of anticoagulant rodenticides in Danish raptors, owls and small carnivores. A base investigation.]",NERI Technical Report,788,NA,"In Denmark, control of rats, mice and voles is almost exclusively undertaken using anticoagulant rodenticides, slow-acting poisons that block the blood clotting ability of target animals. Rodents usually die through spontaneous internal bleeding within 3-8 days following consumption of a single or multiple smaller doses of anticoagulant rodenticides, dependant on type. Anticoagulants bind strongly to fatty tissue and break down only slowly, exposing avian and other vertebrate rodent predators and scavengers to a high risk of secondary poisoning through foraging on poisoned rodents. Secondary fatal poisoning from anticoagulants has been documented in a wide range of species, both in the wild and from experimental trials. Most studies describe specific incidents or relate to suspicious deaths; few studies have been based on systematic collection of individuals to determine the extent of such secondary poisoning and its impact on the health and population dynamics of predators and scavengers. The present study is the first systematic survey to establish the prevalence of anticoagulant rodenticides in raptors, owls and small mustelids in Denmark. The study focussed on species that strongly or periodically depend on rodents as food, i.e. those most at risk of poisoning and those most likely impacted at the population level. The presence of anticoagulant rodenticides in raptors, owls and mustelids was studied in specimens obtained from zoological museums, wildlife management stations, taxidermists, airports, the National Environmental Research Institute and various private persons. Specimens were derived primarily from 2000-2009, supplemented by a few individuals from 1983-1999. Contamination by five anticoagulant rodenticides (Coumatetralyl, Bromadiolone, Difenacoum, Flocoumafen and Brodifacoum) was measured in specimen liver tissue using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and a combination of a fluorescence detector and a photodiode array (PDA) detector. Manipulative experiments were conducted (i) to assess the risk of poisoning to Tawny Owl Strix aluco chicks in the nesting period by supplementary feeding with poisoned mice, and (ii) to determine the levels of accumulation of poison in mice in areas with standard rodent control activity (poison depots) around a game feeding station. Small sample sizes of owl nests and mice allow no firm conclusions to be drawn from these studies, and the results are only indicative of expected scenarios of poisoning. Anticoagulant rodenticides were detected in 84-100% of all avian and mustelid specimens examined. Difenacoum, bromadiolone and brodifacoum were most commonly present. Coumatetralyl and flocoumafen occurred in fewer individuals. The average number of different anticoagulants found per individual ranged between 1.7 in marsh harrier Circus aeruginosus and 3.0 in eagle owl Bubo bubo. Overall more than 60% of birds and 80% of mustelids had two or more anticoagulants in their body. For the kestrel Falco tinnunculus, common buzzard Buteo buteo, tawny owl, barn owl Tyto alba and little owl Athene noctua the average cumu- lative concentration of all anticoagulants in the liver ranged between 35 and 58 ng/g. For the red kite Milvus milvus and the eagle owl, the average concentration was 152 and 162 ng/g, respectively, while concentrations in rough-legged buzzard Buteo lagopus, marsh harrier, long-eared owl Asio otus and short-eared owl Asio flammeus ranged between 9 and 24 ng/g. There was no obvious explanation for the observed differences, but these may be due to the degree to which the species exploit urbanised areas and farmland. The higher concentrations in red kite and eagle owl may relate to their predation of carrion and rats, respectively. The average concentrations of anticoagulant rodenticides in stoat Mustela nivalis and weasel Mustela erminea were 58 and 63 ng/g, respectively. The highest levels of anticoagulants were measured in stoats and weasels. Studies suggest that 200 ng/g anticoagulants in the liver represent a critical contamination level for raptors and owls. Between 5.7% and 22% of the examined kestrel, common buzzard, tawny owl, barn owl, little owl, stoat and weasel had concentrations higher than 200 ng/g. Amongst red kite and the eagle owl the proportion of individuals with more than 200 ng/g liver were 66% and 70%, respectively, while there were no critically high concentrations recorded in rough-legged buzzard, marsh harrier, long-eared owl and short-eared owl, although small sample size for the last species prevents firm conclusions. Overall no differences in frequency and level of contamination were detected between sex and age groups, between time of year, or in relation to the registered cause of death, which could indicate a systematic pattern in the risk of poisoning. For stoat and weasel, concentrations of anticoagulants increased from spring to winter, a trend reflected amongst some of the bird species. Higher concentrations were also present in stoats and weasels found dead, compared to other causes of death, and for both species, body condition were weakly, but significantly correlated with rodenticide burdens. The recorded frequencies of anticoagulant poisoning in Danish birds of prey, owls and mustelids, were markedly higher for most species than those from British studies. The number of anticoagulants recorded per individual was also higher in Danish birds and mustelids than found in Great Britain. Higher sensitivity of the HPLC analysis used in the present study cannot explain this difference. Possible explanations for the differences between Denmark and Great Britain may include differences in landscape structure, in application policies and methods for authorized rodent control and in private use of the anticoagulants available on the open market. The use of anticoagulants over the past 10-20 years to control rodents in Denmark has not had any documented adverse effect on the populations of raptors and owls, as most species have increased in abundance during this period. However, it can not be ruled out that the use of anticoagulants locally or even nationally has elevated chick mortality in some birds of prey and owls, which has slowed their population growth. The experiments reported here showed that chicks of tawny owl fed poisoned mice constituting 35% of their food requirements concentrated critically high levels of poison above 200 ng/g in the liver (even for old birds). The study showed that free ranging mice in areas with standard applications of anticoagulants for rodent control may attain concentrations similar to those used in the feeding experiments. Hence, it is not unlikely that elevated chick mortality amongst raptors and owls may occur as a result of the current levels of use of anticoagulants for rodent control in Denmark. The higher concentration of anticoagulant rodenticides in stoats and weasels dying from unknown causes and lower body condition in individuals with high rodenticides burdens indicate that the present anticoagulant rodenticide exposure have adverse effects on individual fitness and survival. Population development and status of stoats and weasels in Denmark are unknown, but both species are presumed to be in decline. Adverse effects of the massive exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides have the potential of contributing negatively to population developments.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Surveys in different parts of the region revealed the area of highest significance due to concentration of raptor populations. It is the lowland landscape in the upstream and midstream parts of the Ponoy River watershed, called the Ponoy Depression. This is where annual monitoring of breeding raptors was made. It turns out that the Ponoy watershed has retained the last stable Peregrine Falco pereginus population in European Russia. Simultaneously, the Ponoy Depression proved to be a landscape suitable for Gyrfalcon Falco rusticolus breeding. Long-term monitoring of the raptor population (study area ca. 1000 km2) yielded data on the status of populations of the falcons and their breeding success in the Ponoy Depression. Throughout the study period, 18 locations ever occupied by breeding Peregrine pairs have been discovered in the Ponoy Depression. At the same time, total species abundance in the Murmansk region was estimated at 25-30 breeding pairs. The greatest number of territories occupied by the Peregrine in the Ponoy Depression was recorded in 1991 and 1994, and equaled 11. The population reached the highest productivity in 1996-1999. The Peregrine food range in the breeding season comprised over 30 prey species. The most frequently taken one was the Ruff Philomachus pugnax, 52%. Total Gyrfalcon abundance in the Murmansk Region was estimated at approximately 5-10 territorial pairs. A drastic decline in the Gyrfalcon abundance and instability of its breeding in the region have been observed, which seem to be related primarily to the very low level of the populations of the Willow Grouse Lagopus lagopus and other tetraonids Tetraonidae that has lasted for about 20 years. The most frequently taken prey for both the Peregrine and the Gyrfalcon nesting in the Ponoy Depression was the Ruff (43.2% in the food range).",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Specifically, we compared how arctic fox abundance, breeding density and litter size varied inside and outside a large goose colony and in relation to annual variation in small mammal abundance. Information-theoretic model selection showed that (1) breeding density and fox abundance were 2-3 times higher inside the colony than they were outside the colony and (2) litter size, breeding density and annual variation in fox abundance in the colony tracked fluctuations in lemming abundance. The influence of lemming abundance on reproduction and abundance of arctic foxes outside the colony was inconclusive, largely because fox densities outside the colony were low, which made it difficult to detect such relationships. Lemming abundance was, thus, the main factor governing reproduction and abundance of arctic foxes in the colony, whereas seasonal influxes of geese and their eggs provided foxes with external subsidies that elevated breeding density and fox abundance above that which lemmings could support. This study highlights (1) the relative importance of migratory prey and other foods on the abundance and reproduction by local consumers and (2) how migratory animals function as vectors of nutrient transfer between distant ecosystems such as Arctic environments and wintering areas by geese thousands of kilometres to the south.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This study examined the changing status of the marine ecosystem at the island of South Georgia (Southern Ocean) using up to 27 variables measured over 22 years from three upper trophic level predators that specialize in foraging upon krill (Eupuasia superba Dana). These variables included population size, breeding performance, offspring growth rate, foraging behaviour and diet. A method was developed for reducing these multivariate time-series to a single vector, called a combined standardized index (CSI). 2. Sensitivity analyses showed that missing values had a large effect upon the accuracy of the CSI but this effect was reduced if the individual variables were highly correlated. The level of correlation and proportion of missing values within the empirical data set were within the acceptable range. Individual variables had widely varying influence upon the CSI but, in general, those with longer time-series had the greatest influence. 3. Principal components analysis showed that variables representing offspring growth tended to explain the greatest proportion of the variability in the CSI and this was followed by variables representing diet. 4. There were 3 years in which the CSI showed extreme and significantly low values. There was a significant non-linear functional response (similar to the Holling Type II functional response) between the overall CSI and krill biomass and a similar relationship existed when the CSI was calculated for each species individually. 5. Separate analysis of variables that were likely to be representative of changing population size showed the presence of a significant decline between 1977 and 1998. There was no trend in the CSI from variables representative of foraging conditions during the summer breeding season. The study has shown that the marine ecosystem at South Georgia shows acute but transient variability that is amplified in the response of upper trophic-level predators. There is less certainty that trends in populations are a consequence of shifts in the degree to which the ecosystem can support krill-feeding seals and penguins.",10.1046/j.0021-8790.2001.00534.x,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Through observation and experimentation, we investigated the interactions between ghost crabs and plovers on Wild Beach, a Piping Plover nesting area on Assateague Island, Virginia. This site has a high abundance of ghost crabs and historically low fledging success compared to adjacent areas with fewer crabs. We observed encounters of crabs with plover eggs, chicks, and adults in the field, but never predation. In staged encounters of crabs with eggs and chicks (using hatchery reared quail as plover surrogates), we were unable to elicit predatory behavior either on the beach or in the lab. We conclude that although instances of ghost crab predation on Piping Plover eggs and chicks occur, they are rare and cannot account for the high mortality frequently reported on beaches where ghost crabs are abundant. Adult plovers behave toward crabs as if they were dangerous to eggs and chicks, and their young broods in the study area did not forage along the foreshore. Hence, ghost crabs may increase mortality indirectly. Frequent responding to crabs by parents may attract more deadly brood predators. Brood nutrition may suffer as adult plovers direct chicks away from areas where forage is reportedly richer but crabs are abundant, such as the foreshore. Nutrient intake may be further reduced on more southerly breeding grounds where high temperatures on backshores force chicks to stop foraging and take shelter during mid-day. Although high mortality cannot be attributed directly to predation by crabs, it may be due to factors that covary with crab abundance, such as high temperature, behavioral responses of adult birds, and poor forage.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1579,"Chernyshov, Vyacheslav Mikhaylovich (chernyshov@ngs.ru) and Erdakov, Lev Nikolayevich",2017,CYCLICITY OF LONG-TERM DYNAMICS OF REPRODUCTIVE PARAMETERS IN THE TREE SPARROW PASSER MONTANUS,Principy Ekologii,6,2,"The spectral analysis of the multi-year (1984-2005) dynamics of reproductive parameters in the population of Tree Sparrow Passer montanus was carried out in the vicinity of Lake Chany (Baraba forest-steppe). In this species the inter-annual dynamics cycling of the average size of clutches and eggs was revealed. The dominant clutch size cycle of the Tree Sparrow is 11 years. This species may adapt to the cycles of the air temperature dynamics similar in time during the second and third decades of May, when the most pairs begin to reproduce. Since the sparrows fledge mostly with insects, an abundance of which depends on thermal environment, such adjustment provides a higher productivity of individuals and populations in general. Less expressed 3-4-year cycles of clutch size, most likely, are caused by the intra-population reasons. The average seasonal fecundity of the Tree Sparrow depends on the ratio between the first and second clutches. The proportion of second clutches varies with the periodicity of three-year and 12-year (multiple of three). Perhaps this is due to the three-year dynamics of the age structure, as the majority of Tree Sparrow yearling are monocyclic. Rhythm spectra of long-term changes in the linear dimensions and volume of eggs of the Tree Sparrow are very similar. The most powerful cycle lasts approximately 7-year, but there are 3-and 2-year periodic components less expressed on power. Probably the of egg dimensions cycling is determined by a variety of external and intra-population factors (food supply, age distribution of the population, timing and duration of their breeding season).

Three groups (32/group; 16 male-female pairs) of 17-week-old ducks (F0 generation) were fed Purina(R) Game Bird Breeder Layena(R) diets containing mean (+-SD) 33.2 (+-2.7), 68.9 (+-1.8), and 140.9 (+-5.1) mug/g strychnine for 20 weeks, with some pairs in each group fed control diet during a subsequent 3-week recovery period. Three groups (32/group; 16 male-female pairs) of 19-week-old quail (F0 generation) were fed similar diets containing mean (+-SD) 279.2 (+-10.1), 557.4 (+-43.5), and 1,113.6 (+-46.6) mug/g strychnine for 22 weeks without a recovery period. Separate groups of ducks and quail (32/group; 16 male-female pairs) were also fed control diets (0.0 mug/g strychnine) in each study. There were 16 weekly collections of eggs for the mallard study (13 for the diet-exposure period and 3 for the recovery period), and 11 collections for the quail study. Eggs laid during the last 13 and 10 weeks of the diet-exposure periods for ducks (plus 3 weeks of the recovery period) and quail, respectively, were incubated. Each hatch of F1 generation ducklings and chicks was observed for 14 days. Key results were: (1) the no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) for F0 ducks and quail were 33.2 and 1,113.6 mug/g strychnine, respectively-quail showed no reproductive effects at the current doses; (2) decreased egg production and hatching success occurred for mallard hens fed mean 140.9 mug/g strychnine diets; and (3) ""normal-hatching"" ducklings from eggs of F0 mallards fed mean 140.9 mug/g strychnine diets suffered greater mortality than ducklings from the other diet groups.

Populations fluctuated markedly during the four years of research. Extra seed crop in 2003 and probable niche vacation - the density of the dominant Apodemus flavicollis lowered in 2004 -, determined two years (2004-05) of higher bank vole population densities. The relative abundance of C. glareolus was higher in the most variable biotope (RB), consisting of an intensive pheasantry. Also the body mass of adult individuals, particularly females, was higher in RB. The influence of seed crop on the weight of individuals was statistically significant. During winter 2004/2005 a strong impact on the forest regeneration in tree plantings was reported. We argue that vole abundance prediction by periodical monitoring is needed to prevent damage.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1582,"Lanszki, Jozsef",2002,Feeding ecology of mammal predators living in Hungary,Natura Somogyiensis,4,NA,"The present study features seven carnivores examined between 1991 and 2001 namely, otter (Lutra lutra), stoat (Mustela erminea), stone marten (Martes foina), pine marten (Martes martes), badger (Meles meles), red fox (Vulpes wipes) and golden jackal (Canis aureus). The areas studied are in the South-western part of Hungary; contain cultivated agricultural lands (the region of Fono Fishpond, Mike-Csokoly and Ketujfalu), forest (Lankoci Forest at Gyekenyes), or forest surrounding pond systems (Boronka Nature Landscape Area and Petesmalom). The feeding habits of otters was also examined at the aquatic habitats of the Danube-Drava National Park, namely at the Drava River (Ortilos-Szentmihalyhegy and Vizvar), at backwaters (Belavar, Babocsa, Kisbok), at lakes (the quarry lakes of Somogyudvarhely) at abandoned fishponds (Barcs-Rigoc/Barcs Juniper Woodland Nature Landscape Area), at canals (Korcsina and Dombo) and stream (Rinya at Babocsa). To study the feeding habits of carnivores was accomplished by analysis of excrements, using more than 10,000 samples. The feeding behaviour of otters and their fish preference was examined at eutrophic fishponds (Fono Fishpond and Boronka Nature Conservation Area). The correlations coefficients between the otters' fish diet and the available fish stock were generally close. For example at the Fono Fishpond during a 6 year period, the values received were 0.56 (P<0.05), 0.87 (P<0.001), 0.93 (P<0.01), 0.79 (P<0.05), 0.36 (NS), and 0.81 (P<0.001), while during a 2 year period at the Boronka Nature Conservation Area they were 0.02 (NS) and 0.33 (NS), respectively. The occasionally low correlation coefficients indicated that the otters' fish prey selection was determined not only by the availability of species, but also by its size (rS=0.70, P<0.01). The fish preference calculations were performed with Iviev's index of preference (E1, min.:-l, max.: +1). Regardless of species, the otters avoided (Ei=-0.51) fish heavier than 1000 g, with a preference for individuals weighing between 500 and 1000 g (Ei =0.79). No substantial or clear preference was observed in the weight range below 500 g (Ei=-0.02-0.38). The preference for fish in accordance with their characteristic sites of occurrence within the body of water was also significant (P<0.01). They avoided fish living primarily in open water (Ei=-0.64) and to a lesser degree those occurring near the pond bed (Ei,=-0.22). They favoured fish inhabiting the area with a covering of aquatic plants (Ei=0,46) and showed a preference to a lesser degree for fish living in the shallow littoral regions (Ei=0.14). With the cessation of fish farming and the effect of the drastic changes which occurred in the vegetation, the otters fed substantially on the stock of alternative sources of prey such as amphibians and water insects as well as terrestrial animals, and at such time, depending on season, fish became a secondary source of prey. In the aquatic habitats, such as the Drava-District region, like the Drava River, the Barcs Juniper Woodland Nature Landscape Area, the quarry lakes, the backwaters of Belavar, Kisbok and Babocsa the primary source of prey consisted offish, provided there was an abundant fish stock.. The occa-sionally low frequency of occurrence (less than 50-60 [degrees]/o) offish in the diet indicated that the amount of available fish stock was less than adequate or varied greatly from season to season. In these habitats the secondary source of prey (birds, amphibians and reptiles) played an important role. In wetland habitats that partly dry out during the summer, such as the Lankoci Forest or certain canals and streams, the importance of small mammals and water insects also increased, while the significance offish in the diet was reduced. The diet of the otters living in the area of the Tetves Stream (which can be considered a special case) contained an extremely large proportion (62 [degrees]/o) of crayfish during the summer. Due to the greater amount of fish consumption the trophic niche of otters living in ponds was narrower than that of the ones near the Drava's aquatic habitats. The correlation between the frequency of occurrence and the biomass data of the otters' diet was analysed using samples collected at the Ponds of Petesmalom, the Lankoci Forest, and the Tetves Stream. Data according to the various taxa showed significant (P<0.001) Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.92 (mammals), 0.80 (birds), 0,93 (reptiles and amphibians), 0.90 (fish), 0.88 (invertebrates) and -0.78, P=0.066 (plants). The data indicates that frequency of occurrence of prey taxa quantify the consumed biomass with high reliability. The most important elements of the stoat's diet consisted of small mammals, mainly voles. The proportion of small mammals in the stoat's diet was the highest during the winter and decreased continuously towards the summer and the autumn. At the same time the importance of birds and insects increased but reptile and plant consumption could also be detected. In habitats, which differed significantly compared to some of the others, like the Fono Fishpond region (agricultural landscape) and the Lankoci Forest, in spite of the monotony of the stoats' diet their trophic niche was wide according to the main taxa. The number of prey and plant taxa at these habitats studied was 18 or 11, and 4 or 1, respectively. Body weight of the stoats' major prey varied between 15-50 gramms. The majority of prey species was terrestrial but the proportion of arboreal prey was also substantial and aquatic species occurred in the diet as well. The diet composition of the stone marten was analysed in agricultural landscape (around the Fono Fishpond) and in a village (at the inner area of Fono). Individuals of the different habitats often utilised the same source of diet and the size of their niche overlap was 78%. The primarily important food taxa were plants, mainly fruits in the diet at both habitats (based on the annual mean of 34% and 31 % frequency of occurrence, respectively). Besides plants the most important prey taxa consisted of small mammals (20%) in the agricultural area, and of birds (20%) in the village. There was a substantial difference in the consumption of domesticated (mainly poultry) species (4% vs. 15%). The fact that stone martens in the agricultural area more frequently consumed terrestrial and wild prey contrary to their ""urban"" counterparts contributed to their trophic niche segregation. The number of prey and plant taxa of these two areas was 55, 35 and 17, 19, respectively. Prey was typically in the 15-50 g weight category (55, and 47% in the agricultural landscape and the village, respectively) and lived on ground level (81 and 71%, resp.), but martens living in the village hunted more frequently preys above 50 g (14 and 24%, resp.) and arboreal prey (17 and 29%, resp.). The diet of the stone martens living in the agricultural area showed high similarity to those of other carnivores of small and medium body size. The most important items of the pine martens' diet consisted of small mammals both in the Boronka Nature Conservation Area and in the Lankoci Forest. Their proportion was especially high during the winter and spring season. The most important prey species was the bank vole but wood mice also showed high frequency. In the Boronka Nature Conservation Area the pine martens slightly preferred bank vole (Ei = 0.1) and dormouse (Ei -=0.16) as prey, while wood mice (Ei = -0.14) and shrews (Ei = -0.28) were preyed to a lesser degree than their frequency of occurrence in the environment. Birds had secondary importance in the pine martens' diet only during spring and summer. The birds in the pine martens' diet mainly consisted of singing-birds with small body size. Invertebrates frequently occurring in the diet were consumed in small amount. The importance of other diet taxa significantly differed according to the pine martens' habitat. For instance during the winter pine martens consumed substantial amounts of game carcass and fish near fishponds. The importance of plants depended on the season and habitat. Wild fruits could provide the most important element of the pine martens' diet during the summer and played an important role during the autumn as well. The pine martens' diet was characterised by a large number of species and was accompanied by a wide trophic niche in each season. The number of prey and plant taxa of the two areas examined was 62, 49 and 11, 8 respectively. The prey mainly consisted of small animals weighing less then 50 gramms. Though the pine martens are excellent tree climbers the majority of their prey species were terrestrial. Arboreal species featured relatively rarely among their prey. The pine martens' diet composition showed high similarity to that of foxes living in the same habitat. The diet composition of badgers living near fishponds surrounded by forests like the Boronka Nature Conservation Area, and of those in agricultural lands like the area of the Fono Fishpond differed significantly. The diet composition of badgers living in wooded areas was dominated by invertebrates during the winter, and by amphibians from spring to autumn. Small mammals and other prey taxa did not play an important role. The diet composition of badgers living in agricultural land was dominated by invertebrates (especially earthworms) during the summer, and by plants (especially maize) and small mammals (particularly voles) during the autumn. The diet was greatly varied in species but showed a medium to low trophic niche breadth in both regions. The number of prey and plant taxa of the studied two habitats were 47, 25 and 11, 6 respectively. In the diet dominated the terrestrial prey weighing less than 15 g due to the frequent occurrence of invertebrates in it. Badgers differed from other terrestrial carnivores regarding their feeding habits. Their trophic niche was among the narrowest of the species examined, thus they could be regarded as specialists within a given habitat. Badgers utilised different diets in various habitats which indicates their adaptability. The diet composition of the red fox was varied in species together with a wide trophic niche showing excellent adaptability. The diet of foxes living on agricultural land (like the region of the Fono Fishpond or Ketujfalu) consisted of 40-42 prey and 10-12 plant taxa, respectively. Foxes of the wood habitat showed more taxa in their diet, 66 prey and 15 plant were observed at the Boronka Nature Conservation Area and 47 prey and 8 plant taxa at the Lankoci Forest. The most important items of the diet was provided by small mammals (46-94 % by biomass) depending on the season and characteristics of the area. The main prey species were the common vole a cause of economic loss in agricultural areas, and bank vole in the forests. The weight of the majority of their prey ranged between 15-50 g. In the Boronka Nature Conservation Area the red fox slightly favoured bank vole (Ei= 0.11) and avoidedo wood mouse species (Ei = -0.14), which were hunted less than their frequency of occurrence. A considerable trophic niche overlap was observed between the red fox and other medium sized terrestrial carnivores. Golden jackals settled back to the south-western part of Hungary during the last decade. Jackals living on the edge of their habitat range, mainly consumed small mammals during the winter and early spring (56%). Consumption of game carcass also played an important role in their diet (red-, roe- and fallow deer and wild boar - the proportion of them biomass consumed was 46% altogether), most important was the wild boar. Other taxa like birds, reptiles, amphibians, insects and plants did not play a major role in the diet. Hunting of small game (hare, pheasant) was insignificant. The diet of red foxes living in the same area contained 36% small mammals and 49% game carcass (by biomass consumed). The diet composition of the jackal and the red fox did not differ substantially and their trophic niche overlap was high especially according to biomass data (72%). Individuals living in the central area of the jackals' habitat range in Hungary primarily consumed small mammals (their proportion of consumed biomass ranged between 83-97%, depending on the season), the main item in their diet was common vole. Based on live trapping of small mammals during the autumn jackals favoured common vole (Ei = 0.33), while avoided forest species, such as bank vole (Ei -0.59) and wood mouse species (Ei,= -0.77). Consumption of ungulates (mainly carcasses) was increased at the end of spring and summer but even during this period they could only be regarded of secondary importance in the diet. The trophic niche breadth of the jackal was low regardless of the season due to the high proportion of small mammal consumption, which resulted in a small mammal specialist behaviour. Small mammals also dominated (80-94 %) in the diet of foxes lived in the same area. The diet composition of the jackals and foxes (coexisting the same habitats) were not significantly different, their trophic niche overlap varied between 76-94 % depending on the season. Regardless of the habitat and season an exceptionally high similarity could be observed between the diet composition and feeding habits of jackals and foxes. However, differences could be detected between jackals living on the edge and in the central area of their habitat range (the same phenomena can be stated concerning the foxes). This indicates that the characteristics of the habitats substantially determine the feeding habits of these carnivores. Both species can adapt well to the circumstances provided by a given habitat, which can lead to a diet characterised either by the consumption of considerable percentage of game carcass or of small mammals. The diet composition ofjackals avoiding urban areas differs greatly from that of larger predators, their body size and hunting behaviour is between those of the wolf and the red fox, but closer to the red fox",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1583,"Morrissette, Manon and Bety, Joel (joel_bety@uqar.ca) and Gauthier, Gilles and Reed, Austin and Lefebvre, Josee",2010,"Climate, trophic interactions, density dependence and carry-over effects on the population productivity of a migratory Arctic herbivorous bird",Oikos,119,7,"Several driving forces can affect recruitment rates in bird populations. However, our understanding of climate-induced effects or bottom-up vs top-down biological processes on breeding productivity typically comes from small-scale studies, and their relative importance is rarely investigated at the population level. Using a 31-year time series, we examined the effects of selected environmental parameters on the annual productivity of a key Arctic herbivore, the greater snow goose Anser caerulescens atlanticus. We determined the extent to which breeding productivity, defined as the percentage of juveniles in the fall population, was affected by 1) climatic conditions, 2) fluctuations in predation pressure caused by small rodent oscillations, and 3) population size. Moreover, we took advantage of an unplanned large-scale manipulation (i.e. management action) to examine the potential non-lethal carry-over effects caused by disturbance on spring staging sites. The most parsimonious model explained 66% of the annual variation in goose productivity. The spring North Atlantic Oscillation and Arctic snow depth were the primary climatic parameters inversely affecting the production of juveniles, likely through bottom-up processes. Indirect trophic interactions generated by fluctuations in lemming abundance explained 18% of the variation in goose productivity (positive relationship). Mean temperature during brood-rearing and disturbance on staging sites (carry-over effects) were the other important factors affecting population recruitment. We observed a strong population increase, and found no evidence of density-dependent effects. Spatially restricted studies can identify factors linking environmental parameters to local bird reproduction but if these factors do not act synchronously over the species range, they may fail to identify the relative importance of mechanisms driving large-scale population dynamics.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1584,"Heggoy, O. and Shimmings, P.",2020,Status and threats for Eurasian eagle owl in Norway Scientific basis for revision of national action plan,NOF Rapportserie,4,NA,"The Eurasian Eagle Owl Bubo bubo (hereafter referred to simply as Eagle Owl) is the largest owl species occurring in Norway. It is also among the most threatened owls in the country. Eagle Owl was placed in the category ""Endangered (EN)"" on the Norwegian redlist for species in 2015. An action plan for Eagle Owl was finalised in 2009, and since then several measures have been implemented in line with that same plan. The plan will be reviewed and updated on a regular basis, in order to update the knowledge base for further actions, as well as to customise future work on the species. This current report forms the basis for a reviewed action plan for Eagle Owl in 2020. One of the most important measures considered in this report is gathering of information via mapping and the establishment of a national Eagle Owl monitoring programme, as well as studies into diet, the effects of pollutant loads, and factors affecting prey availability. Additionally, a considerable amount of effort has been undertaken regarding mapping and mitigating measures for electrical power cables in proximity of known nest sites for Eagle Owls, with the aim to reduce the risks of electrocution from, and collisions with, such cables. Results from the national monitoring programme, as well as from other studies in Norway, show that Eagle Owl has stable populations in several areas with high densities of breeding pairs. However, at the same time there are declines in some more sparsely populated areas such as in Telemark and parts of south-eastern Norway. Studies on the diet of Eagle Owls in central Norway emphasise in particular the importance of open landscapes and wetland areas as hunting grounds for many established pairs. Wetland birds and gamebirds such as grouse have been shown to be among the most important prey species in terms of biomass. Seabirds are important prey items for many coastal Eagle Owls. Rodents, including field voles and water voles are also important prey items, as are frogs. Studies on the effects of grazing livestock (in this case from an ancient breed of sheep ""gammelnorsk sau"") in Luroy in Nordland county, have shown that sheep negatively affect populations of water vole, which are the most dominant and important prey species for Eagle Owls in that same area. Research on pollutant loads in Norwegian Eagle Owls has revealed that rodenticides are a major threat for some owls. Additionally, other environmental pollutants such as PCBs, have been found in high concentrations, particularly among coastal Eagle Owls. Measures along power lines ought to be an important part of work relating to the action plan in the foreseeable future. In order to secure necessary information important to area planning, then mapping of Eagle Owl territories needs to continue, at the very least at current levels. Whenever calling Eagle Owls are recorded, efforts ought to be focused towards locating nest sites. The national monitoring programme on Eagle Owls ought to continue, such that information is available on reproductive success, adult survival and population development. The results from all mapping and monitoring will be reported into a species-specific national module (""Rovbase""). Many Eagle Owl territories are today subjected to development plans close to known nest sites. Often, this is not desirable if Eagle Owls are to remain in the area, and such developments probably contribute to the decline in occupied territories.

It is also vital to address the issue of safeguarding those areas that are preferred hunting habitats for hubro, including wetlands, old and open woodlands, as well as seabird colonies.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1585,"Taylor, A.J. and O'Halloran, J.",1999,"The decline of the corn bunting (Miliaria calandra) in the Republic of Ireland, with reference to other seed eating farmland birds","The decline of the corn bunting (Miliaria calandra) in the Republic of and Ireland, with reference to other seed eating farmland birds.",NA,NA,"In northern, central, and western Europe, the Corn Bunting, (Miliaria calandra), is largely restricted to farmland habitats, particularly cereals, other tillage crops, temporary grasslands, and hay meadows. The diet of the Corn Bunting consists mainly of seeds and cereal grains in winter and a mixture of invertebrates and seeds during the breeding season. In the Republic of Ireland, the decline in Corn Bunting numbers began in the early twentieth century or possibly earlier. It is probable, although not certain, that the Corn Bunting is now effectively extinct as a breeding bird in the Republic of Ireland, and remains only an occasional winter visitor. Corn Bunting populations have also shown severe declines in other western and central European countries. Many other species of seed eating farmland birds have undergone severe declines in range and/or abundance in Europe over the last 30 years. There are no population size data for these species in Ireland, but most have undergone range declines over the last 30 years (e.g., Grey Partridge, Turtle Dove, Goldfinch, Linnet, Twite, Redpoll, and Yellowhammer). Due to the large proportion of land in the Republic of Ireland utilised for agriculture (approximately 80% of the land surface area), even species more commonly associated with other habitats can still have a large proportion of their national population dependent on farmland. There are no good quality data available on any aspect of the ecology of the Corn Bunting in the Republic of Ireland, or indeed on other seed eating species. In the absence of such data, the results of studies in other countries, on both Corn Buntings and other seed eating farmland birds, were reviewed. A range of environmental factors has been proposed as being responsible for the declines of these species. In conjunction with Irish data on environmental factors, an assessment was made of whether any of these factors were likely to have been contributing to the range declines in the Republic of Ireland. Environmental factors which may have caused the population declines in Corn Buntings include predation, disease, and parasites, weather patterns and climate change, and changes in the agricultural environment. There is no evidence that predation, disease or parasites have affected Corn Bunting population size, but none of these factors have been studied systematically and so their importance cannot be assessed. It has been suggested that climate change has contributed to the decline of the Corn Bunting, but there is very little evidence to support this idea for the twentieth century declines, and some evidence to reject it. Even in the absence of significant long-term trends in climate, short-term local severe weather patterns may have contributed to the decline of the Corn Bunting by increasing the extinction probability of small, isolated populations, but there are no data to support this. Much of the available data on the ecology of seed eating farmland birds are insufficient to establish causal links between population declines and agricultural changes. There is, however, a substantial body of work from the UK and continental Europe correlating range and/or population declines of seed eating farmland birds (including the Corn Bunting) with concomitant changes in agricultural practice. There are also studies demonstrating patterns in demographic parameters, especially breeding success, between farmland habitats that are consistent with changes in agriculture being the cause of population declines. Based on these data, the decline of the Corn Bunting in the Republic of Ireland is thought to have been due to a decrease in over-winter survival rates and/or a decline in breeding productivity. Over-winter survival decrease may have been caused by: (A) A decline in the area of winter foraging habitat (B) A decline in food abundance (mainly weed seeds and cereal grains) in remaining winter habitatsBreeding productivity declines may have been caused by: (C) A reduction in the area of suitable breeding habitat. D) A decline in food abundance (mainly invertebrates) in remaining breeding habitats (E) A decline in the number of suitable nest sites in remaining habitats Changes in the agricultural environment of the Republic of Ireland which may have contributed to the decline of the Corn Bunting (and indeed other seed eating farmland birds) are: The long term decline in the area of land under tillage crops, especially cereals and the concentration of remaining tillage in the south and east of the country (see A and C, previous paragraph) he decline in mixed farm enterprises and the loss of crop rotations including grass leys (A and C) The continuing switch from spring-sown to autumn-sown cereals (A, B, D, and E) The intensification of grassland management, including the switch from hay to silage (B, D, and E) The loss or degradation of uncultivated habitats such as hedgerows and botanically diverse field margins (A, B, C, D, and E) The increased use of fertiliser (D) The increased use and efficacy of pesticides (B and D) Changes in grain harvest and storage techniques (B) The Corn Bunting has been in decline in the Republic of Ireland since at least the 1900s. Declines throughout Ireland during the period 1900 to the 1960s were likely to be related to the declines in the areas of tillage crops, especially cereals. By the 1968-72 the breeding population of Corn Buntings in the Republic of Ireland was essentially split into two groups: one largely restricted to the west, north-west, and south-west coastal districts and one largely restricted to the tillage-dominated south-eastern districts. The former population was probably predominantly found in the areas of coastal mixed farming. The continuing switches in these areas from cattle to sheep grazing, and from hay to silage, together with the almost complete disappearance of oats (and therefore winter stubbles), potatoes, and fallows, probably contributed most to the post-1960s loss of Corn Buntings. The south-eastern population group was found in an area dominated by arable and mixed farms, all more intensively managed than on the west coast. Here the post-1960s Corn Bunting declines were probably more influenced by the reduction in crop diversity due to farm specialisation, the decline in the areas of spring cereals and over-winter stubbles, the loss of hedgerows, and other non-crop habitats, and the increased use of fertilisers and pesticides.There is an urgent need for research into the causes of range declines in farmland seed eating birds in the Republic of Ireland. It cannot simply be assumed that the exact causes are identical to those in other European countries, even when these are known, since different combinations of environmental factors may determine habitat occupation, population densities and population ecologies in different regions. The Breeding Bird Survey (BirdWatch Ireland/ Duchas) will provide population trends for many farmland seed eating birds in the future. A clear understanding of any the ecology of any species, however, requires detailed studies of foraging behaviour, habitat-specific breeding biology, productivity, survival rates, diet, and food availability, disease, parasites, and predation, not just surveys of distributions and densities. More generally there is a need in the Republic of Ireland for more studies of farmland wildlife ecology. There have been severe declines in many species of broad-leaved plants and invertebrates across the European Union, particularly on arable land. Such losses cannot be prevented or reversed without a thorough knowledge of the distributions and ecologies of farmland flora and fauna.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This effort is part of the broader NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program's (CRCP) National Coral Reef Ecosystem Monitoring Program (NCREMP). With support from CRCP's NCREMP, CCMA conducts the ""Caribbean Coral Reef Ecosystem Monitoring project"" (CREM) with goals to: (1) spatially characterize and monitor the distribution, abundance, and size of marine fauna associated with shallow water coral reef seascapes (mosaics of coral reefs, seagrasses, sand and mangroves); (2) relate this information to in situ ine-scale habitat data and the spatial distribution and diversity of habitat types using benthic habitat maps; (3) use this information to establish the knowledge base necessary for enacting management decisions in a spatial setting; (4) establish the eficacy of those management decisions; and (5) develop data collection and data management protocols. The monitoring effort in northeastern St. Croix was conducted through partnerships with the National Park Service (NPS) and the Virgin Islands Department of Planning and Natural Resources (VI-DPNR). The geographical focal point of the research is Buck Island Reef National Monument (BIRNM), a protected area originally established in 1961 and greatly expanded in 2001; however, the work also encompassed a large portion of the recently created St. Croix East End Marine Park (EEMP). Project funding is primarily provided by NOAA CRCP, CCMA and NPS. In recent decades, scientiic and non-scientiic observations have indicated that the structure and function of the coral reef ecosystem around northeastern St. Croix have been adversely impacted by a wide range of environmental stressors. The major stressors have included the mass Diadema die off in the early 1980s, a series of hurricanes beginning with Hurricane Hugo in 1989, overishing, mass mortality of Acropora corals due to disease and several coral bleaching events, with the most severe mass bleaching episode in 2005. The area is also an important recreational resource supporting boating, snorkeling, diving and other water based activities. With so many potential threats to the marine ecosystem and a dramatic change in management strategy in 2003 when the park's Interim Regulations (Presidential Proclamation No. 7392) established BIRNM as one of the irst fully protected marine areas in NPS system, it became critical to identify existing marine fauna and their spatial distributions and temporal dynamics. This provides ecologically meaningful data to assess ecosystem condition, support decision making in spatial planning (including the evaluation of eficacy of current management strategies) and determine future information needs. The ultimate goal of the work is to better understand the coral reef ecosystems and to provide information toward protecting and enhancing coral reef ecosystems for the beneit of the system itself and to sustain the many goods and services that it offers society. This Technical Memorandum contains analysis of the first six years of fish survey data (2001-2006) and associated characterization of the benthos (1999-2006). The primary objectives were to quantify changes in ish species and assemblage diversity, abundance, biomass and size structure and to provide spatially explicit information on the distribution of key species or groups of species and to compare community structure inside (protected) versus outside (ished) areas of BIRNM. Methods: For each biannual survey mission, selection of sample sites occurred via a stratiied random design (2001-2006) using hard and soft bottom habitat types delineated in NOAA's benthic habitat map (Menza et al., 2006). In 2003, after implementation of the park's Interim Regulations, sampling was also stratiied by whether or not the site was located inside or outside BIRNM to evaluate effect of the ishing closure (only 2003 to 2006). Fish were surveyed during daylight hours along 25 m long by 4 m wide belt-transects for a ixed duration of 15 minutes. All species observed were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic level and their abundance was counted and grouped by size class. To quantify benthic habitat, ive 1 m2 quadrats were randomly placed on the transect and used to examine the relatively fine-scale biotic and abiotic components of the seascape (e.g., coral cover, macroalgal cover, etc.). In addition, Geographical Information System (GIS) tools were used to quantify the seascape surrounding each transect using habitat distributions represented in NOAA's benthic habitat maps (e.g., amount of seagrass, number of habitat types, etc.). Comparative analyses of biotic components inside versus outside BIRNM were conducted using a wide range of ish variables representing community, trophic, family and individual species level data incorporating measures of abundance, biomass and diversity. A total of 884 transects collected between 2003 and 2006 inclusively were used to examine differences in ish metrics inside versus outside BIRNM. Benthic comparisons used 716 benthic surveys on hardbottom habitat types conducted between 2001 and 2006. Abundance maps were used to examine species distributions for both juveniles and adults and interpolations of point data were used to examine broad-scale spatial patterns of ish and benthic habitat variables. Major indings: Diversity hotspots [center dot] Despite heavy impacts from disease, bleaching and hurricanes, the area around the eastern tip of Buck Island remains ecologically distinctive having some of the highest live coral cover and rugosity in the mapped region, also with high calcareous coralline algal cover, high ish species richness, biomass of herbivorous ish and high abundance for many common ish species.[center dot] The linear reef (i.e., barrier reefs) and adjacent colonized pavement that extends east-west from Teague Bay to Coakley Bay and now falls within the EEMP ""no-take zone"" and ""recreation zone"" was found to support high coral species richness and fish species richness. [center dot] Extensive areas with high coral species richness, high live coral cover for Montastraea cavernosa and M. annularis, high ish species richness and high abundance for several ish species including coney (Cephalopholis fulva), rock beauty (Holacanthus tricolor) and queen triggerish (Balistes vetula) occurred along the northernmost edge of the benthic habitat map. This indicates that important deeper water habitat is likely to exist beyond the scope of this report, requiring further benthic habitat mapping effort combined with visual census (diver/remotely operated vehicle [ROV]) to capture data on ish communities (see Foster Mission web site: http://ccma.nos.noaa.gov/products/biogeography/ usvi_nps/overview.htm). [center dot] Many of the coral reefs with highest ish species richness were within 200 m of seagrass beds. Several other studies have demonstrated links between ish distribution on coral reefs and proximity to seagrass beds suggesting that many species may beneit from complementary resources provided by seagrasses in close proximity to coral reefs. This highlights the importance of considering mosaics of habitat types in resource management decision making. Benthic habitat [center dot] The benthic environment inside BIRNM was signiicantly different to the outside for 75% of ine-scale variables quantiied within 1 m2 quadrates and 78% of seascape variables quantiied within 100 m2 radius seascape units surrounding each transect. [center dot] Seventy-eight percent of the mapped area inside BIRNM was hardbottom habitat dominated by colonized pavement and 22% was softbottom (sand and seagrasses); outside BIRNM, 46% was hardbottom and 54% softbottom. Seascapes inside BIRNM also had signiicantly higher mean habitat richness. [center dot] Coral cover for all major scleractinian (hard coral) families was signiicantly higher inside BIRNM and coral reefs had a signiicantly higher ratio of live coral cover to macroalgal cover than outside BIRNM. [center dot] Overall, hardbottom habitats of the study area were dominated by turf algae (37%) and macroalgae (11.4%), with mean scleractinian coral cover of only 5.6% ranging from 12.1% on patch reefs to 2% on the less rugose reef rubble. [center dot] Across years (2003-2006), macroalgal cover showed some indication of decline both inside and outside BIRNM. [center dot] Filamentous cyanobacteria/macroalgal blooms were detected in the fall sampling period with mean cover as high as 18% in October 2005; a year with anomalously high summer water temperatures that also resulted in a mass coral bleaching event. [center dot] Peaks in mean algal turf cover (50-60%) were detected in the spring (2006) season following the mass coral bleaching event and mean live coral cover approximately one year after the event was the lowest since this study commenced. Fish [center dot] A total of 201 ish species/species groups were identified from 56 families. Nine of the 10 most frequently encountered species belonged to the families Labridae (wrasse), Acanthuridae (surgeonish) and Scaridae (parrotish). [center dot] The majority of the most abundant ish across the study region were found in highest densities over hardbottom habitat types, yet most also utilized multiple habitat types including seagrasses and sand. [center dot] Fish metrics signiicantly higher on hardbottom habitat inside BIRNM included ish biomass (all ish combined), herbivore biomass, parrotish biomass, shark and ray biomass, coney (C. fulva) density and biomass, blue tang (Acanthurus coeruleus) density and biomass, and striped parrotish (Scarus iseri) biomass. [center dot] Fish metrics signiicantly higher outside BIRNM included ecologically important predator groups such as piscivore biomass (including sharks and rays), snapper (Lutjanidae) density, and grunt (Haemulidae) density and biomass. [center dot] Red hind (Epinephelus guttatus) and coney (C. fulva) exhibited distinct patterns in spatial distributions, with high coney density mostly over the contiguous colonized hardbottom areas (much of which is inside BIRNM) and high densities of red hind found mostly to the south of Buck Island (many outside BIRNM). [center dot] Very few of the largest (>35 cm) and very few of the smallest (<5 cm) size classes were observed for groupers (Serranidae) and snappers. Groupers and snappers in the largest size class (>35 cm) were recorded at <1% and 3%, of survey sites, respectively. [center dot] Body lengths of the largest individuals of several common groupers, snappers and grunts were less than the maximum size recorded for the species. The largest yellowtail snapper (Ocyurus chrysurus) was approximately 70% of the maximum known adult size, schoolmaster snapper (Lutjanus apodus) 66%, bluestriped grunt (Haemulon sciurus) 65- 76%, white grunt (H. plumierii) 56-66% and red hind (E. guttatus) 60% of known maximum size. [center dot] Highest densities of threespot damselish (Stegastes planifrons), a potential indicator of healthy reefs with high live coral cover, were found around the eastern tip of Buck Island within BIRNM and the fringing reef extending east-west along the northeast coast of St. Croix.Historic and recent changes in ish populations [center dot] Synoptic overview of inter-annual differences inside and outside BIRNM showed no consistent decline for any of the 39 ish metrics inside BIRNM, but instead showed increases every year between 2003 and 2006 for mean ish density (all species combined). Densities in 2005 and 2006 were signiicantly higher than 2003. It is not yet clear if this has resulted from initiation of NPS Interim Regulations and enforcement patrols. [center dot] No such increases were recorded outside BIRNM, instead considerable and consecutive inter-annual decline was apparent for grunt biomass, especially bluestriped grunt (H. sciurus), and density and biomass of stripped parrotish (S. iseri). Densities in 2005 and 2006 were significantly lower than 2003. [center dot] Only three Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus), three yellowin grouper (Mycteroperca venenosa) and one tiger grouper (M. tigris) were observed in the study region over the course of six years of monitoring using 1,275 samples. Notably, these three species were completely absent from the Buck Island nearshore areas in 2001-2006, but were present in low abundance in 1979. These grouper species are highly vulnerable to ishing due to their large body size and relatively slow maturity and this historical difference in abundance indicates that the grouper have been overished. [center dot] In contrast, coney (C. fulva) and red hind (E. guttatus) were more abundant around Buck Island between 2001 and 2006 than in 1979. [center dot] Threespot damselish (S. planifrons), a potential indicator of healthy reefs with high live coral cover, was more abundant around Buck Island in 1979 than in the 2001-2006 sampling period. Macroinvertebrates [center dot] Long-spined urchin densities (Diadema antillarum) around Buck Island have not recovered since the mass mortality in 1983. However, this study and the scientiic literature indicate that some minor recovery may be occurring in lagoonal and back reef areas along the sheltered coastline of northeastern St. Croix. Long-spined urchins were once important ecosystem engineers controlling the abundance of algae in the region and little is known about the factors (e.g, limitations to recruitment) that are controlling population recovery. [center dot] Coral reef ecosystems of the study region, particularly the large expanse of seagrasses between Buck Island and St. Croix support regionally important populations of adult and juvenile queen conch (Strombus gigas). This is important since queen conch is an important food resource in the Virgin Islands and according to NOAA's Ofice of Protected Species, queen conch is declining throughout the species' range. Recommendations: Additional mapping, inventory and monitoring efforts are required to explore the deeper water ecosystems within the BIRNM that exist outside NOAA's current benthic habitat map. In addition, acoustic tracking studies may reveal the mechanisms underlying some of the observed temporal changes in fish communities and will determine connectivity between lagoons and coral reefs offshore. Tracking will also provide important information on the time that individual ish spend inside and outside the boundaries of protected areas. Very little is known about the timing of movements during the daily home range, ontogenetic shifts and spawning migrations and spatial pathways for such movements for most species. Some targeted surveying for specific substrate types may be required to identify the extent of suitable settlement habitat for juvenile grouper in the study region or whether groupers are instead immigrating into the region from settlement habitat outside. Long-term monitoring is necessary to determine the magnitude of the apparent declines and to track the trajectory of recovery for species that exhibited an increase in density after several years of decline. Long-term monitoring effort may also reveal direction in the change for the many species that were too highly variable from year to year to provide such information over the four years of data used. Within the BIRNM-EEMP Marine Protected Area (MPA) complex, resource managers and stakeholders should examine the option of closing the gap between the southern boundary of BIRNM and the no-take zone of EEMP along the northeastern coast of St. Croix. An adjoining of the boundaries would incorporate an extensive area of seagrass habitat thus ensuring full protection of important complementary resources that provide food and habitat for many ish (both resident and transient species). These seagrass beds are also regionally important habitat for queen conch and may provide important resources for Caribbean spiny lobster. Further targeted surveys are required to assess and monitor the status of queen conch populations and to determine whether long-spined urchins are recovering. Such information will help to determine if management intervention is needed to assist recovery of sea urchin populations and to evaluate the conch ishery. Additional work to map the distribution of juvenile and adult Caribbean spiny lobster populations using existing survey data and to determine the factors that explain spatial distributions would be very valuable in supporting ecosystem-based management of marine resources in the region. Benthic habitat maps should be periodically updated due to the dynamic nature of coral reef ecosystems. This is particularly important when linking ish seascape structure and when assessing seascape change such as quantifying gain or loss of major habitat types.",NA,,JRY,No,,,No,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
